FI-IMPACT Assessment and Benchmarking Webapp
======
This on-line self-assessment tool was developed as part of FI-IMPACT, an EU funded research project under
the Future Internet PPP programme. Based on questionnaires and external performance indicators a set of 
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) is calculated in order to guide  SMEs and Entrepreneurs. 
This tool, when integrated into a corporate environment, gives SMEs and Entrepreneurs the ability to monitor 
their potential impact and to learn what elements are needed to drive impact and evaluate changes. 
In addition to the self-assessment, we have developed a possibility to integrate external performance indicators
 in our Assessment system. This tool also encompasses an advanced dynamic benchmarking tool that helps sub 
 grantees to understand their performance in the FI PPP ecosystem through sub-sets of aggregate attributes, 
 performance indicators and high-performing project. 
 Sub grantees, or their mentors, can thus perform a gap analysis comparing "my" performance against other initiatives.
