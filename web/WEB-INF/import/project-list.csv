ÿ

Crowdfunding for the creative industries in Europe have 2 main components:

Reward based crowdfunding, where goods or services are sold in exchange for a donation
	Equity based crowdfunding, where you can invest in starting companies in the creative industries by buying shares
However, many individuals in the creative industries would prefer to reward their funders in exchange for a part of the profit. This is currently not possible via the reward method, while the equity investment would immediately require a participation in the entire company (in case this would exist).

ÿ

By building a crowdfunding platform which allows a profit participation based on the creative work in question, build on theÿRSS (Revenue Settlement and Sharing) FI-WAREÿ? would enable a platform in which profit participation on the work in question is possible. This would be application to all creative industries, such as design, music, film &amp; TV, gaming, and many others. This would be a new class of crowdfunding, situated between the current for of crowdfunding by rewards (dominated by US players such as IndieGOGO &amp; Kickstarter) and crowdfunding by equity (due to regulation very country specific). In the attached presentation you can find a more extensive competitive description

ÿ

Since the profit-participation has no regulatory hurdles, this can be launched across Europe, and would allow aÿEuropean leading and disruptive platform, based on the FIWARE components.

ÿ

The 2 FI-WARE components that we would implement are:

-ÿThe Revenue Sharing System (RSS) GE is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the usage of a given service among the involved stakeholders

-ÿIdentity Management (KeyRock):ÿIdentity Management covers a number of aspects involving users' access to networks, services and applications, including secure and private authentication from users to devices, networks and services, authorization &amp; trust management, user profile management, privacy-preserving disposition of personal data, Single Sign-On (SSO) to service domains and Identity Federation towards applications.

ÿ

The implementation of would allow to implement a form of virtual shares (crea-shares) that allow to have stakeholder involvement and participation from theÿcrowd, also for projects from creative industries, such as design, fashion, music, , jewelery, gaming, tv and other. The US platforms ? which are currently the market leaders ? do not allow this form of participation, creating a unique opportunity for Europe based platform to lead by innovation !

ÿ

In such, the development and implementation of a CREA-SHARES platform will lead to more entrepreneurship in the creative industries. We could see the platform as an enabler for more creative entrepreneurships. As such, you can see this as the activitation of a know principle, and would lead to a form of ?Profit Shares?.

ÿ

Additionally, this also creates the following:

a user test of the idea, concept, design
	clear advantages related to creating a fan-base. This are not only helping to fund the project and give feedback, but will lead to ambassodors that will act as sales enablers and even ambassadors

This industry has identified the rising art costs as their largest problem. The Artomatix solution is an automated art-creation software application that will significantly disrupt the art production process for video games. The goal is to halve the time and halve the cost to make a video game.

ÿ

The overall objective for Artomatix is to deliver the next generation of graphics tools, based upon the first Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that can mimic human-like artistic creativity and can semi-automate the process based on examples. By semi-automating the generation of art, Artomatix will expand the games market and significantly disrupt the current art creation process by:

Enabling digital graphic artists to focus on high-creativity tasks rather than spending time on mundane low-creativity tasks (e.g. painting each individual brick in a wall)
	Improving art generation efficiency and consequently reducing project times and costs
	Providing studios with the means to keep art creation in-house, thus reducing or eliminating their reliance on Asian Art outsourcers
In the longer term, people (game designers for example) that are lacking in artistic talent will also be able to use this technology to create the vision they have in their mind.

ÿ

To make this happen, Artomatix needs to port the present, stand-alone prototype software, to the cloud.

That is the focus of this project, Artomatix Cloud.ÿ

ÿ

ÿ A double service platform

ÿ

1. It will enable to quickly generate visuals and customized video of any real estate project. Thanks to geolocation, the 3D models will be visible in their urban environment. This quickly generated animation prototype wil bring following functionalities : people could use it unchanged if quality is sufficient for their need; or, where appropriate, user will be able to submit the prototype to a certified 3D production studio and get a high quality film (rapid prototyping of 3D animation). Briefing time of the 3D studio is thus strongly accelerated and the risk of misinterpretation of the briefing is reduced.

ÿ

2. Our platform enable final user to visualize the project in an interactive way thanks to an online user interface. (webGL, Unity 3D, Unreal Engine) The content may also be visualized on location thanks to an Augmented Reality mobile app. User will be able to scan a facade and visualize the future renovation in Augmented Reality. The tool will be very useful for real estate development and town planning.

ÿ

The tool provides many features that allow people to make decisions. Here is a non exhaustive list of features that would come with the tool :

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿImportation of files from any current architectural/3D software (Autocad, Sketchup,...);

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿIntegration of environment (road, trees, street lamps, houses, buildings, etc) thanks to automatic integration engine (see with enablers POI Data Provider or Google Earth API and other). Some objects will be automatically integrated, but other customised detail like cars or humans (use of Fiware GE : Virtual Characters) could be added manually (by the user, or by us);

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿExport of high quality fix images with oriented view on a point of interest. We could use POI Data Provider (FIware GE) to collect information on point of interest near the place we look at;

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿSimulate brightness, sunlight and shadows depending on the hour of day, the season, etc (Solar calendar) defined by the user;

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿEnable user to create a basic and high-end architectural film for different purposes : Convince authority and town planning department, help for neighbourhood surveys, pre-sale available habitations in real estate projects, potential tenant etc.

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿEnable user to give a complete briefing and provide a 3D animatic that can be sent in production in a 3D studio. Based on the animatic, the studio will be able to produce a high-end film (Pre calculated 3D)

? ÿÿÿÿ ÿThe ability to order several preset camera travellings around one point of interest. Realtime 3D video over the point of interest.

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿThe ability to create a ?subjective view? camera travelling by choosing different crossing points and therefore make a realtime 3D video passing by different places (number of places to be defined in the pricing).

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿSome parts of a construction could be visited in an interactive way (real-time 3D). This experience could be enjoyed with Virtual Reality technology (Oculus Rift).

? ÿÿÿÿÿÿSet to traffic information (urban, road, air, etc) and their impact.

It provides an easy-to-use user interface to visualize static, time-dynamic and context-based information in a graphical manner. Created visualizations (infographics) can be embedded into websites, used as single page websites or exported to single page mobile application for smartphones or tablets.
The most recent ipunkt (one of the leading web application developers for publishing industry) study on digital publishing identified three major consumer whishes on digital content, which are up-to-dateness, individuality and mobility.
Future Internet needs to fulfill these wishes by offering innovative solutions to content creators, including journalism, publishers, advertisement, designers, arts, museums and many more. Graphical visualizations of information become increasingly popular (cf. over 2mio. created infographics on the infogr.am platform alone) as data has become one of the strongest arguments in our data-driven world and storytelling visualizations are a perfect tool to make them amenable. This is a neccessary step to enrich people's everyday lives using the flood of information provided by the Future Internet. This is a relevant issue for major parts of creative industries.
fisualize supports three kinds of information, including a totally new dimension to infographics, building on these developments. Static information is every kind of static text, graphical element or picture, whereas time-dynamic information is information that changes over time and is usually loaded from databases, especially open data. A once created infographic updates when being loaded by a content user and refreshed in defined time intervals. Additionally, fisualize adds context-based information to the content creator's construction kit. This kind of information represents a completely new approach of up-to-date, mobile and individual content. Context-based information is user-specific information from sensors like location, noise, temperature or even statistical data collected on the user's mobile device.
Using fisualize, content creators may visualize these kind of information or use it to filter and select other data by a simple and intuitive graphical programming approach.
If a web user loads an infographic created with fisualize by a content creator, the browser or mobile app first requests relevant contextual sensor data, loads up-to-date dynamic data from relevant databases and finally generates the user-specific infographic, that the user can share in social networks.

By this approach, fisualize profoundly changes how content is produced, distributed and consumed by allowing media companies or individual creatives to create a new personalized customer experience. Note that this approach keeps user interaction very simple by offering individualization in a non-intrusive, magic way. The users do not have to enter any information by theirselves.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Although there are many efforts to reduce paper consumption, document printouts offer a better experience than reading on screen in many cases. Especially in creative industries printouts are indispensable to get a good impression of dimension and color of print media, to get a quick overview on large documents or to work with high dimension documents like technical drawings, and there are many more cases. As a consequence there exist various copys of a document and not only a single one on a central document server. Beside printouts, there exist versions on eBook-Readers or tablet PCs that do not have a connection to a document server. Therefore, It is often difficult to find the corresponding digital document in a document repository when working with a print out or reading on an Ebook-Reader.

truffledoc finds documents in a repository by simply capturing the document copy (printed out or on a screen) with a mobile device's camera. One can select the identic or a similar document and open it on any device with internet access in the web browser by scanning an QR code on the truffledoc website without needing to enter credentials in the browser, but with full security of data transfer by ssl. So it is even possible to open a documents on an untrusted PC/device without needing to enter the repository login data on the untrusted device. Moreover truffledoc is able to overlay annotations of the document in the document repository on the document the user is currently working with by agumented reality. It may extract the paper annotations and merge them into the digital document in the repository.

truffledoc will totally change user's interaction with documents by blending any kinds of document representations in the digital and in the physical world. It establishes mobile devices as a second screen in working environments to playfully jump over the gap between different devices and even between physical and digital world, creating a smart user interaction and amazing user experience.

ÿ

Use cases are to read some piece of paper, usually without filename or document title printed on it and need to get the whole document by downloading it to your PC. Or to print out a large scale document (e.g. a large drawing), pin it to the wall and use your mobile device to overlay individual annotations, that are available in the digital document, to it using your mobile device (and even find the file again by one click, if you missed to print the filename on it). Or being at a customer's place and want to give him/her a document - you do not have to enter your server credentials on a foreign PC anymore or to share flash drives, use your mobile device to authorize document access instead. Or sitting in a presentation and want to download the current slide, that is somewhere on the document server, to your tablet - capture it and load it.

There are a lot of tools in the content space, but they suffer from a couple of disadvantages. First, they cover a part of the content space, for example social media, or web, whereas distribution is a multiplatform business. Secondly: data stays in silos, because content and content marketing organisations use a wide variety of tools (social media analytics, web analytics, A-B testing etc) that do not communicate. On top of that there is no grip and real overview because there are no powerful visualisations of content distribution concepts that span across those platforms and silos.

ÿ

CleverLions has developed a dashboard ÿ(name: SmartOcto) that visualises the whole content strategy, multiplatform, and focuses on real impact. It has modules on influencers, scraping, social media and ROI, but can also make use of existing pro tools within a media organisation.

ÿ

Important perspectives: the CleverLions dashboard captures the history but focuses on the future. It calculates the momentum of content and gives real time alerts when content has a lot of engagement or virality factor. In that way publishers, broadcasters and content marketeers can influence the impact of their content in realtime or at birth, not when it is at the end of the lifecycle.
Secondly: it has a holistic approach on impact. Clients choose their KPI, which could be different than only views, or social media likes. SmartOcto lets media organisations establish the relationship between their content strategy and other business goals, like sales or engagement.

Thirdly: in the coming times it will make the shift from predictive analytics to prescriptive. SmartOcto will calculate the best ?moves? in contentdistribution (?your audience is in Facebook now, please post this video, it has a high virality factor?) and send out an alert to the right people in the organisation.

ÿ

A lot of the unique visualisation concepts in the dashboards (see mockups section) have been validated in the business environment of public broadcasting and are ?proven technology?. They will be generalised for the whole content sector.ÿ

a creative discovery application

ÿ

The product. 

CREACTIVA aims at the development and exploitation of a novel, playful and low-cost ?creative discovery &amp; recommender application? that attempts to provoke entrepreneurs to think ?out-of-the-box?, and in consequence boost disruptive ideas and innovation, in the benefit of a responsive society.

Operative goal: ÿ?Based on your usual ?comfort zone? data, CREACTIVA starts applying big data/graph mining and new creative discovery processing techniques (ie. through concepts blending *, bisociations, etc) thus to discover out-of-the-box perspectives and recommend you potential (existing and/or new) creative ideas?.

ÿ

* About conceptual blending: Knowledge discovery and computational creativity have until lately been investigated by two separate research communities. However, research in bisociative, cross-context knowledge discovery has recently started addressing creative tasks, including creative literature mining. Bisociation is a term coined by Arthur Koestler in The Act of Creation (1963), and recently by Fauconnier and Turner (2008) in conceptual blending. It basically refers to the bridging or mixture of concepts from two contexts or domains that are normally considered separate or hidden. 

An example: The old cash register idea emerged thanks to the ""bridging of concepts"" (blending) between a ship propeller counting engine and a restaurant need for management.ÿ


To put this conceptual approach in context, let?s analyze a simple scenario:


			?Lucas is an aspiring entrepreneur with a deep knowledge in the E-commerce sector (comfort zone, his domain), he knows there are plenty of space for innovation in Logistics and Stock Management (out-of-the-box: other domains), but these are well known and he wants to make something truly innovative that helps him to stand out of the crowd when pitching to investors.

			To accomplish thisÿhe starts thinking about these other sectors or knowledge domains, not directly linked to his domain: E-commerce, trying to discover hidden relations between them, that help him to put together something really disruptive.

			However Lucas won?t be able to execute all the tasks involved in this analysis in a timely manner, mainly due to the enormous volume of information available and its unstructured nature?.
			
		ÿ

CREACTIVA is the tool Lucas needs for detecting and assessing new domains, and discovering new ideas and hidden relations, whether existing (unknown for him) or totally new (unknown for everybody). It isÿable to analyze large volumes of information, and applying different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniquesÿin creativity, it discovers untapped relations, scoring them and finally presenting results to Lucas in a simple, powerful and highly usable way.

ÿ

At the end, this application triggers computedÿcreative ""sparks""ÿto boostÿhis creativity, allowing him toÿundertake truly disruptive projects.

ÿ

The Services.

Our product concept will be based on diverse types of services and interface functionalities: from playful exploring, to discovering new sparks, from scoring to filtering the relevant sparks, amongst others. A total of 6 separate domains are considered thus to get a great amount of rich findings.

ÿ

The technology.

The product/services will be developed through 2 main phases:ÿthe Mockupÿdevelopment (early prototype) andÿtheÿfinalÿfully functional Prototype. Both developments will mainly consider key items as: Domains characterization, Web mining, NLP and machine learning (forking the tool Pattern, developed by Tom de Smedt), AI techniques (conceptual blending), the architecture and the Fiware GEs to use.

			PostCard Creators are companies which are more or less print shops, small or huge print shops. We want to develope a software solution so that they can print a trigger system on each single card in order to make every card unique. That sounds as a huge effort but we will control it by a software cloud system which is very easy to control because only, if activated, a trigger is used as a data file which is completly and forever related to that PostCard.

14,CREA14,CREA,CREAtiFi,UK,Divido Financial Services Limited,Divido,"5 Bonhill Street, c/o Seedcamp, EC2A 4BX London, United Kingdom","BANKING, WHOLESALE AND RETAIL TRADE; REPAIR OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND MOTORCYCLES",0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Fredrik Borgquist,"At Divido we are in the process of redefining the Point of Purchase (PoP) for finance in the digital age. Our technology will enable online merchants to provide consumers with credit through a smooth online process. The plan is to let online merchants offer a simple, quick to use finance option at the PoP for consumers who don?t want to pay in full upfront. The merchants are able to provide 0% financing as a marketing tool by subsidising the interest rate making this a very attractive option for the consumer. Designed from the ground up around a paperless e-signature process, customers will get an instant decision and can ?sign? their credit agreement on screen. No paper forms, no waiting, no hassle.

ÿ

Once a customer has been approved for financing (based on pre-agreed criteria with lenders) the lender settles the full amount with the merchant within 24 hours. The lender collects the monthly instalments from the consumer until the outstanding amount has been settled in full. The lender pays Divido a commission for all credit brokered.

The lender takes full responsibility for debt collection, managing bad debt, providing debt management advice to the consumer. The merchant manages general product consumer customer service after the finance has been approved.

ÿ

Divido achieves the above and will stand out from competition by:

(a) Multiple finance options: if declined by one lender, alternatives are presented. This mean more transactions will be approved.

(b) Additional credit: consumers are shown how much more they can finance.

(c) Catering for long tail: finance transactions from ?250, aiming for an average order value of ?750 and above.

(d) API: allow merchants manually to add Divido as a payment option. This also includes integration with the most popular eCommerce platforms such Megento and Venda so that merchants on these platform can add Divido as a payment option in just a few clicks.

(e) Mobile optimised: intelligent UX makes it easy to apply for credit on a mobile.

(f) Support: Divido will provide support to merchants during office hours (Business Development or Developer as appropriate) and the lenders will provide support for consumers applying for credit. The lenders will also provide FCA stipulated debt management advice services.

(g) Payment Guarantee: merchants are guaranteed to always be paid in full.

(h) Customer reporting: partners and consumers can view their transactions online.

(i) Consumer Intelligence: consumers using Divido only have to register once so subsequent purchases will be facilitated quickly. Each time someone applies or completes a purchase via Divido their shopping habits and payment history are recorded. This information will later be made available to merchants that want to target their previous consumers, consumers? shopping habits and information about additional credit they are entitled to, in order to facilitate cross selling and up-selling. This feature will be rolled out ÿto merchants for an additional fee, or offered for free to create additional stickiness, once a critical mass of user data has been collected.

Creativity and innovation are widely recognized as of crucial importance for the functioning of modern organizations, commercial and non-commercial alike. This is equally true for the ability of employees to solve problems and engage in informal learning. Each of these processes relies on the flow of knowledge between employees, which in turn is contingent on the social cohesion and the transparency of the knowledge distribution in the organization. Knowledge silos exist, often between departments, preventing many larger organizations to achieve a higher level of creativity and innovation through collaborative problem solving and informal learning.

ÿ

The Sparker way

Sparker runs on a number of tables, placed at strategic social locations in the organization. The tablets are connected to an RFID reader. Employees can perform check-ins on the tablet using their Sparker RFID card to score points for their team. They can engage in a Sparker conversation, by checking in with another player of their team. Both players are presented with a number of conversation topics that are based on their user profiles. By performing these actions, players can score point for their teams.

The overall state of the game and the recent activity can be followed through a responsively designed website. In addition, the website allows participants to perform missions that are tuned to organizational goals, like contributing ideas through a crowdsourced ideation campaign.

As players need to fill out their profiles in order to participate, this data becomes available to the organizational leadership, who can query it and perform analysis using the Analytics dashboard. This yields insights in the interests and competencies of the employees, which can be used to e.g. find out what issues are alive in the organization or to create teams in a more targeted way, combining different areas of expertise.

At its core, Sparker provides a new way of letting people meet in a meaningful way. It offers an experience that brings people together and stimulates them to build social contacts that are based on meaningful discussions. The ZWERM prototype, on which Sparker is based, produced design research knowledge on how to build systems that activate and consolidate the social fabric. Our paper ?ZWERM: a Modular Component Network Approach for an Urban Participation Game? won a ?SIGCHI Best of CHI Honorable Mention Award? at the CHI 2014 conference and we believe that it would be a missed opportunity not to bring this type of application to the market.

ÿ

Primary market

The market and especially the ?Learning &amp; Development? segment has sent out a number of positive signals, strengthening our belief that the concept has market potential. Nowadays, the vision on learning has changed from strictly formal to a combination of formal, informal and social learning. However, there is lack of clear insights and data on where knowledge is located in the organization and how knowledge can be exchanged between colleagues. Sparker solves these issues to a certain extent, making it a promising instrument for engaging in social learning and obtaining data on future needs and opportunities.

ÿ

We have engaged in a track at BNP-Paribas Fortis to implement Sparker for their 17.000 strong staff. In addition, we have received interest from Belfius bank to test the application when it is finished.

ÿ

Secondary markets

Focusing on large organization with knowledge silo?s looking for ways to engage their employees in a playful way is the most promising marketing strategy at this time. However, we have also identified that the concept would be applicable to spark social cohesion at events (conferences, business fairs,?) in schools (to server educational content) or in cities (as was done in ZWERM).ÿ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Everybody also knows the business coach. I want to combine them both. For me the people are the heart of the business. But most of the timethe staff is considered as a burden. Company leaders often think you can not rely on your staff.

For me the staff is the people who makes it possible to grow your company even more. They are the beating heart and the centre of the corporation.

ÿ

I think it is rather logic people don?t know how to motivate other. We simply didn?t learn it. We learn to talk, but not to talk about the things that matters the most. We learn so much in school, but we don?t learn to communicate in a respectful way. We learn that there are people we have to listen to and be quiet when they speak. A teacher, boss, director is always right because the rank higher on the superior ladder.

ÿ

For me respect and responsibility are the basic values in people. So I have made a prototype of new creative online hr trainings. I want to help business owners of SMEs to find the motivated collaborator so they can lift their business higher and generate more revenue.

ÿ

For a long time you had to be though and objective in business. You had to think with your head. You weren?t allow to make decisions with your heart. My creative part in these training is that I?m convinced you have to do business with your heart. It is all about passion. Passion makes you move boundaries and reach for the sky. Passion makes you attract the right people for your business. Passion gives you enthusiasm, joy and freedom.

ÿ

Nowadays hr-people motivate company to hire the best man on the job. They have created a hole list of questions to keep everything as objective as possible. Mostly it means that the person with the best test results will get the job. But will this man be the best fit with his colleagues? Will he represent the company in the way the owners wants to be represented?ÿ

ÿ

So I want to create an online training which gives business owners without hr department tools the hire to ideal collaborator for his company. I help him from creating a vacancy and to identify his needs to get the best person sign the employment. I want to create a training where the owners really learns about the strengths and weaknesses of his business. Where the owners really know their business as good as themselves so they know what collaborators they need.

ÿ

The second training I want to create is a training where the business owner can built a better relationship with his staff just to build open communication. Communication without pride and prejudice. I want to give tools to the business owner to make difficult conversations really easy. Lots of leaders don?t know how to tackle difficult issues such as work ethics, ? They delay though conversation in the hope the problem will fade. But the problem will only escalate. I have great tools to open up the bond between an employer and his employee. I want to create an online training which can help the employer step by step in guiding him with the bonding with his staff.

ÿ

So the basic idea of my online training is to provide the soft skills of the hr to the business owner. They built up their company with their passion and skills. And then there was the need for staff because he couldn?t handle it on his own. But the minute you begin with staff you have less time to do the things you love most and are best at. So with these hr-trainings I want to help them out with their staff. Because people are social being. It should all come natural: the knowledge how to work together with others.ÿ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Marketing departments were among the last departments that got impacted by IT.ÿ The last years with the social media / mobile/ÿ big data hype, a lot has changed.ÿ However, despite this advance (and momentum), we can say that marketing still operates in a silo in most companies.ÿ This because this advance in marketing technology has not been absorbed by the rest of the organisation.ÿÿ As a result, a lot of potential remains untapped: sales is still complaining that marketing does not help them with lead generation and supporting sales.ÿ Whereas marketing still works on an island, complaining they lack input from the field (sales, backoffice)ÿ in order to be able to conduct the right segmentations, predict customer behavior, anticipate competitor actions, etc...

Also, information that is (or not yet) gathered about competitors is not processed in such a way that is becomes usefull to sales, marketing and general management.

ÿ

Solution:

The goal is to develop a platform that breaks the boundaries between sales, marketing and the backoffice, by:

* Assuring that multiple CRM, ERP, and marketing automation tools can integrate on a data and process level

* leveraging open data as to enrich our knowledge of our customers and competitors coming from the above mentioned systems

* Providing artificial intelligence to support business processes and decision making.ÿ These algorithms should be relatively easy to configure by business analysts

* Provide a visual representation, tailored to the role of the business user

ÿ

ÿ

The software will comprise following elements:

* SaaS software platform, able to visualize and interpret data and do predictions

* Connectors to be installed within the customer ÿfirewall so data can be extracted

* Connectors that can extract data from the cloud

* Add ons for specific software components (first focus: SAP ecosystem), enabling our customers to use data and intelligence also in backend systems to steer processes of any kindÿ

* FIWARE used: GIS Data provider, Application Mashup

ÿ

Target market:ÿ

* Process industry (Main focus EU, although we expect to have a global presence once certified by SAP)

ÿ

Sales and marketing strategy

* As a member of the SAP Startup Focus Program, we'll be able to sell our solution, once certified, using the SAP sales channels to their customer base of 250.000 customers. ÿContact: james.crawford@sap.com. ÿWe're also an Adobe partner.

* Next to that, we have a strong network within the SAP market, which can be leveraged

* Finally, we'll also aim to generate leads using online/inbound marketing, outbound calling of target customers, etc...

Competitive advantage/USP

Break down silo's between sales, marketing and back office by integration all available data, both from within as well as outside the company, allowing:

Data and process integration
	Quick google like search on all relevant data, regardless of source system or API
	Visual representation of data
	Calculations of scores and predictions
Focus on industry specifics for process industry: e.g. location of customers and competitors with regards to transportation costs, determination of regions where additional sales effort is needed as to avoid production over-capacity, etc...

Presence at congresses, receptions, seminars and exhibitions remains the most efficient way of extending your network as a businessman.

ÿ

A lot of people see these events as a necessary evil. Which interesting profiles are present? Who to talk to? Can someone introduce me to that one person? How can I put my company and me in the spotlight on these events? How do I keep track of all newly acquired contacts? In order to successfully experience an event, these questions should be answered as much as possible.

ÿ

Event organizers would like to facilitate this ultimate experience for the attendees. In order to do so they need to collect data about the event participants. Which workshop was the most popular? Do people like the gadgets that are placed in the central hall? What sort of relations exists between the attendees?

ÿ

Further improving the event experience has advantages both for the attendees as for the event organizers. But an optimization would also have a significant economic impact on the event industry, since both efficiency and effectiveness are increased. However there is more than an economic incentive. Conferences, receptions, seminars, exhibitions and networking events are the basis of meeting new people and sharing innovative ideas. By easing the exchange of these bright ideas, the whole society could benefit.

ÿ

Our product will be the combination of a tool, the so-called beacon, and a mobile and web application. The attendee application will be a mobile app; the organizer application will be a web application, as well as an application suitable for tablets.

ÿ

Aÿsmartphone applicationÿwhere users can see all the events they subscribed for and use our technology. Based on LinkedIn connections the app shows relevant attendees. At the event the app notifies the user when he is close to potentially interesting contacts.

Food is not only energy. Food is experience, local, global, seasonal, health, sustainability, global warming, animal welfare... Food literacy is an important element to cope with the future of food.

Food or drink recipes are omnipresent online. However to find the recipes you like or easily adapt these to your liking or needs is not possible. A limited number of websites give feedback on the taste profile of the dish or filter out certain recipes, but the results are very limited.ÿ

In the ideal case a recipe would tell you how it will taste like, how much you will like it and how you can adapt it to fit better your preference, dietary restrictions, your requests like seasonal, local, sustainable food...(and teach you more about food).

The service we want to develop isÿpersonalizing existing recipes. In this project a website to register your flavour profile and a Chrome plugin to visualize and personalise recipes online will be created.ÿ

Over the last 8 yearsÿFoodpairing has developed one of the world's largest flavour database containing chemical aroma analysis, taste analysis and texture profiles. Foodpairing is cooperating with universities all over Europe to analyze food ingredients. Up till now more than 1500 ingredients have been fully characterized. Also seasonality, local, nutrition has been added, but for this information we would rely on other webservices.

Algorithms based on this flavour database have been developed to calculate the best match, the best replacement,... One of our algorithms is able to replace an ingredient (and quantity) with the best matching alternative taking restrictions into account. We invest a lot of effort to continuously improve the data and the algorithms.

We will create a website to make a personal profile including dietary restrictions, ratings of dishes and ingredients (explicite information). The tool to assist during recipe search will be a Chrome plugin. From the usage and behaviour of searching recipes, the tool will learn and improve flavour profile of each user.

Whenever you visit a recipe online, your plug-in will be able to translate the recipe into a flavour (taste and aroma) description. This flavour description will be compared to your flavour profile and a liking score will be generated. By selecting an ingredient from the recipe, suggestions will appear with an indication how much they will improve your liking. In case ingredients you don' t like e.g. cilantro appear in the recipe or you have a gluten allergy, the automatic suggestion will indicate and suggest solutions. When an alternative is selected, the quantities of the recipe will be recalculated.

The Chrome plugin is a starting point for the services we want to develop, a proof of concept.ÿ",Service provider,,X,0,0,0,0,,Software,Consumer application,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,www.foodpairing.com,SME,25000,foodpairing.com

Gigdiving (the ?Company?) is a young and vibrant platform in the online live event and concert industry. The headquarters of the company is located in Utrecht, the Netherlands. The focus will initially be on eight countries: the Netherlands, China, Taiwan and their neighbouring countries. The opportunity Gigdiving offers is to make the fans and bands finally reach each other, while currently they are struggling to find each other and make event happen. Gigdiving offers online platform which is primarily driven by the fan base (by the demand-side of the live music industry or called as pull approach) and stimulated and managed by the artists. ÿGigdiving has the first mover advantage, as there aren?t many platforms that enable the fans to drive or directly influence the live music industry. The platform will officially launch from January 2015 and will serve as a one-stop destination for all the stakeholders in the live music events and concert industry.

ÿ

During the first year of operation, Gigdiving will largely be focused on customer acquisition (by connecting the artists and fans), marketing, PR, and building a world-class technology team to sustain a rock solid infrastructure. Gigdiving will create a buzz and allow the company to give amazing top-notch service to the initial customers. The company will also target certain profitable segments and will expand in a phase approach.

ÿ

The company will partner with various strategic alliances (e.g. booking agents, other indie music platforms, sponsors, promoters, etc.) to provide quality services to its customers. The company is also very keen on providing the latest features on the online event and concert promotion industry backed up by lower prices and reliable services. We will stand out with high quality by using cutting edge technology, providing first-hand information, enhancing user experience, experienced management team and state-of-the-art customer care for its customers.

The market demand for live music and concert has been growing across the globe. The current supply in the industry is given by a few large operators, servicing the demand from customers. Yet, there is no online platform provider that offers successful specialized services to serve the purpose for make fans and bands reach each other, eliminating the risk for the middleman in the live music and concert industry.

This gives the smartphone user the ability to see what the external camera is seeing, have the ability to take pictures with the external camera that functions as a third lens to his/her smartphone, and receive these photos instantly on his/her device (smartphone/tablet). All of this with seamless integration of these photos into the cameraroll of the user.

ÿ

We will be selling predominantly B2B, more specifically we have zoomed in on a select handful of target customer segments: the event sector (festivals/conferences/?), clothing stores, urban experience, tourism, city-marketing and city games. Our pilot-projects are currently several small clothings stores and two larger festival events in Belgium. The ambitions are to become a global versatile player in the software as a service (SaaS) for the remote controlled cameras market.

ÿ

The value added is that all photos taken with these cameras will be branded with the logos and marketing content the B2B customer wishes to display on it.

For music festivals this can be the sponsors or the festival itself, for clothing stores their brand, for cities the cityname and touristic referrals, etc.ÿ This is explained more precisely in the PDF with supporting materials


In the segment of events we help the organisors or sponsors with:

Content creation (own content + user generated content) and we optimalise the conversation potential surrounding their brand/event.
	We increase their visibility, during the event as well as after the event.
	The pictures with branded tag are uploaded to social media, businesses can use this opportunity to promote their brand.
	Business can generate data from their customers.
ÿ

In the segment of clothing stores we offer the owners of the stores:

A unique way to integrate social media management
	The ability to allow their customers to discuss doubtful purchases with their soundboard (partner, friends, parents, ?) in real-time with feedback on visual (branded) content of the customer trying on the clothes.
	Increased shopping impulse for the soundboard.
	An extra in-store shop experience pulling customers into the stores.
ÿ

It is important to notice that the user is not the buyer. The users are the festival visitors or the customers buying clothes in stores and taking head-to-toe pictures. The buyers are the event organisers and clothing stores trying to expand their brand reach and visibility.

ÿ

The technical implementation of this wireless connection builds on Bluetooth for 1o1 relations and close proximity. For one-to-many relationships (multiple users at the same time) Wi-fi connectivity is enabled, being carried on a local Wi-Fi network or 3G (or higher) data connection.

ÿ

We started of as a manufacturer of hardware, having built a few minimum viable products (prototypes) for this third lens to your smartphone application. However, recently we shifted gears to focussing on the software enabling this remote wireless communication with cameras leveraging on the existing cameras of Sony. Here we are building on an open API beta SDK Sony has licensed. This gives us a faster time to market projection, less resources required and cheaper overall production.

ÿ

Extra: We do not exclude selling directly to individuals but are aiming at businesses for their bigger market size.

For over ten years now our SME defines the sound of brands and corporations and provides them with tailor-made music - be it a simple ringtone, the song for a commercial or the curated soundtrack for hundreds of stores. In short: we do Corporate Design for the Ear. Our work is closely linked to an extensive archive, filled with tagged music files ranging from little known underground tracks to mainstream hits. Our idea is to make this archive accessible to our brand clients with a closed platform named PLAYERMAKER, offering scalable services for 3 major scenarios. Thus brands will be allowed to present music in a clearly defined way to dedicated customer groups - think of Soundcloud with a dedicated business-to-business use.

ÿ

One might immediately have the impression that such services already exist in abundance. However the very opposite is true, since all current applications (Spotify etc) had been developed for end consumers. Companies at the backend though completely lack means to control the actual distribution of music. To date no commercial application is available, which offers to businesses eg. one of the following 3 services:

allow for a specified number of free downloads of tracks (eg. first 666 for a gothic album)
	offer novel/niche music we hold valid licenses for, but which are not yet licensed by the cloud service itself and are hence systematically blocked
	offer dedicated 24h radio program as promotional gift to business clients instead of the usual ashtrays/umbrellas (eg. ?Lavazza Radio? for coffee bars)
Soundcloud offers single track / playlists sharing, Deezer and Spotify enable continuous streams. Our past cooperations with these well-established platforms though proved their inadequacy for sophisticated services for the above reasons. Our envisioned platform specifically aims at business to business use, the focus is on a creative agency?s needs to overcome such restrictions.

ÿ

Target Market
We particularly want to enhance and improve typical business cases like the following for brands using music in marketing activities:

Selecting music for clients that they can licence for their video productions. We call this use ?Compilation Player?.
	Supplying clients with reviews of record releases or interviews, supplemented by a stream and/or download of a song. We call this use ?Embedding Player?.
	Selling to our clients a 24h streaming radio which they can offer as a sponsored marketing tool to various outlets. We call this use ?Radio Player?. (cf. 4.1)
Advantages / Business Model
Commercial advantages on several levels:

ÿ

Immediate: Saving time resources

Undue portions of working time no longer ?wasted? by disproving copyright infringement claims from Soundcloud for tracks legally licenced by us
	Smoothening of workflows
ÿ

Near future: Decisive product portfolio expansion

Advanced streaming service functionalities
	Ability to deliver fresh, little known content (eg ?new releases radio?)
	Deliver to shop owners a ready-made, emotionally engaging radio program without repetition, geared to their target group
	Sell this service to brands that sponsor it to be used by smaller outlets (eg. beer brewery can sponsor a ?Beer Radio? for bars)
In contrast to Spotify?s new ?Soundtrack Your Brand? approach our service will not rely on the small portion of music-savvy shop/bar owners, but will address the majority, who are no music specialists. We will concentrate on this main use case to explain our sales strategy and evaluate challenges and risks (5.4).

It supports standard content types (text, video, social feeds), as well as multi-screen interactive infographics and multimedia documentary shorts.

With this we react to the changes of our core partners, the broadcasters. They changed their story telling from a solely linear structure to an interactive platform.

ÿ

ÿ

The tool will be a useful device for the audience to interact with non-fiction content. They can take part in questionnaires, can discuss about the topic and furthermore have the chance to get more information on specific topics. Our example is based on the interaction with a non-ficition tv series called ?Exakt ? So leben wir!? by the MDR. This series works with many graphics and data. This way our prototype has the opportunity and the very special potencial to really take part in an interactive programm and to suppport the existing brand.

ÿ

Creating a second screen concept will enhance the audience experience with this kind of format. The audience has the chance to take part in a topic which affects them in their life as well. The content of the audiovisual concept is close to the lifestyle of their audience. This urges the user to tell their experiences or to be part of the discussing community. The special chance we have is to ipmlement our submitted project within a working tv brand such as ""So leben wir"" to reach many users. Each episode of ""So leben wir!"" has about 700.000-1.000.000 viewers nation wide.

ÿ

Within this submitted project we want to work together with graphic designers, developers and programmers to create the needed programming for those two devices.

Broadcasters have a high demand for such solutions to connect more intense with their audience. Still their budgets are tight. Our flexible solution avoids from-scratch software development and is marketed as part of a holistic content concept. Broadcasters outsource the majority of their productions to external companies. We have a long-standing business relationship with several broadcasters on the German market. Their editorial departments are increasingly faced with the need to develop interactive concepts, but have only scarce experience in interactive content and application development. This is why it is hard for technology companies to sell service concepts. We are now able to build a network with experienced technical staff to create the needed interactive programms. This submitted solution can be the first step in integrating smart interactive solutions within non-fiktion tv experiences. It has the potential to create a new way of projects and contents for a new generation of hosts or broadcasters and interactive platforms.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

After a successufl launch of the application in Venice, we plan to offer expansion to other cities, but each app will be tailored to the specific history and elements of those locations. This enhances the value of the location of each project, as they can only be experienced fully in the cities they take place in. Ghosts of Venice is seen as a progenitor to further AR ghost applications in other cities throughout the world.

			Ghosts of Venice will tell ghost stories, which are based on the history and unique architectural features of Venice. Operating through a smartphone (and later through AR glasses), users will be able to search for and view ghosts while following stories through the city.

			The ghosts are defined as 3D models in the application. These ghost are created in different ways by mixing traditional filming in a studio with 3D modeling technologies. Ghosts can be represented as a 2D video layer, which is played as a 3D texture layer on the architecture of buildings in Venice. Additionally, we will use 3D scanning technology and animate the ghost models. This can be done by creating the 3D scan of an actor and then rigging the virtual bond structure (for example with Mixamo) and animating it. Additionally, by using the RGB-D toolkit, ghosts can be created by filming actors with the combination of a Microsft Kinect and a HD video camera (2D image). The result is a depth map of 3D data with video texture from the 2D camera.

			As an AR app and mixed-reality film, Ghosts of Venice also includes elements of gameplay to enhance the way users follow ghosts through the city. By implementing different FIWARE specific enablers, we are able to integrate social interaction and game play into the experience.

			Ghosts of Venice will be sold as a stand-alone application in the Apple and Android app stores. The primary revenue source will be the cost of the app to users, with a target price of 5-10 Euros, similar to the cost of an ebook or interactive app. Beyond the direct revenue source, the opportunity will develop for relational sales to local businesses, or integration with cultural entities such as museums to increase their visitor volume and sales.

			As a location-based storytelling experience, the application can increase the value of locations to users. This allows the ability for local businesses and cultural organizations to benefit from having the app in their locality. It is foreseen that partnerships can be developed to allow for integration with local businesses as part of the ghost stories, and increase their sales.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Makerstack will accelerate the process of instantiating a new business idea by a maker or a team of makers applauding collaboration and allowing community funding even when a project prototype might not have been completed.

ÿ

In order to promote an innovative idea, makers typically 1) develop prototypes which prove their idea's validity; 2) search for funding opportunities in order to reproduce the prototype applying large-scale manufacturing methods and bulk supplying of raw materials thus minimizing production cost.ÿMakerstack is addressing this problem by creating a web-platform, supported by a network of makers, whose rank and reputation is the key factor for a community-based fund raising. The rank and reputation system, is a key component which is usually missing in today's crowd founding web-platforms; a maker is required or even obliged to present a prototype of a business idea in order to start or join a crowd funding campaign which is usually time-consuming and requires resources which may not be accessible by any maker.ÿ

ÿ

Makerstack as a service providing platform is designed as a two-component system; the first component comprises a domain-oriented, tag-based information sharing and exchange library while the second component is a crowd founding enabled project presentation section which will promote makers' projects and prototypes based on makers' reputation and skills. The information exchange service is the core component of Makerstack which is to be a modern, maker-oriented, tag supporting, question-and-answer-based library which aims at enabling makers sharing knowledge, skills and experiences as well as getting feedback and further elaborate or expand creative ideas and projects. ÿInformation exchange will operate on a membership basis; each member is building reputation and acceptance by the community, during his/her involvement, utilising a sophisticated ranking system.ÿ

ÿ

The crowd-funding component enables the funding of a maker or creator counting in the reputation gained. Highly accepted and trust-worthy makers can easily form teams that may pursue community funding avoiding the time and resource consuming step of creating detailed prototypes or analyzing challenges and risks that may not be obvious/visible when starting a new project. The Makerstack's sophisticated member ranking system is mainly based on the members' participation in the information sharing library by utilizing a community voting system but it will also exploit metrics, data and sources of external web sites when available. These data and metrics that are correlated to members; such as Stack-overflow user's reputation, Github.com activity for software developers or Etsy.com reviews and sales for Etsy members etc, hackaday.io skulls will accelerate building presentable experience and reputation.

ÿ

The idea of ITEMSO was born at home - the wardrobe is filled up with cloth, the storeroom is filled up with Christmas decoration and other items which are not of daily use, the cabinets are full of old exams which ned to be kept ring binders are piling up with tax declarations, records of completed projects and other documents which need to be kept due to tax legislation. We consume constantly and day by day more items are filling up our homes. For sure, this is not an individual problem ? this is THE problem of the urban population in metropolitan areas. YOU NEED SPACE!

ÿ

What to do with items you want to keep, but do not need (at the moment)?

ÿ

Public self-storage warehouses are not the solution ? too time consuming and rather for large items and space problems. Further it requires time to organize cardboard boxes and to deliver and pick up your items.

ÿ

THE ISSUE? 

ÿ

Real estate prices are climbing up in major metropolitan areas, rent is increasing and floor space of apartments is decreasing. Lifestyle increases and for hobbies we always need the right gear and equipment ? biking, hiking, snowboarding, kite surfing ? you name it!

We all talk about paperless office, but we still need to keep tax records, don?t want to throw our bachelor theses away and love to hold a book in our hands from time to time?

We own 1000 CD?s, but have all our music in a cloud ? available on any device!

Every year before Christmas and Easter we decorate our home with passion and love, but where to put it afterwards?

We consume day by day ? buy things we must have and items we don?t need!

Things are piling up ? we need space to fill space to keep things we don?t need!

ÿ

THE SOLUTION

ÿ

ITEMSO - cloud storage of physical goods. ITEMSO is the new way of urban storage ? you box it ? we store it!

Simply go online, register instantly with your Facebook account, select the number of boxes you need for the items you want to store and select a delivery day / time / service which is convenient to you ? done!

As requested the empty storage boxes are delivered ? to your door! You decide how long it takes you to box it. Keep an online inventory of your items you store, so that you can trace them easily in case you need them. Schedule a pick up once you are done or drop it conveniently at one of the drop off points of the parcel providers.ÿ

Storage has never been easier and the best thing ? you decide when and where and don?t have to leave your home!

Self storage is nothing new ? just in UKit is a 355 million pound market. More and more public self storage warehouses opening their doors to customers renting out minimum space of 1 square meter. Even those providers are offering their customers rental vans to attract them ? customers need to move their things to storage and pick them up. For bulky items it is a good solution ? but not for the everyday items.

ITEMSO is covering the gap between storing items at home and at public storage ? cloud storage of physical goods! This is the outstanding concept of remote storage ? the customer orders a standard storage box which is delivered within 24 hours and is returned full! This can be done conveniently at home. For all boxes an inventory is kept online in order to trace the items boxed.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

ÿ

Today, SMBs typically use over 10 different web apps. This proliferation of web apps creates new problems. A major time-consuming problem for employees and businesses is finding information within these ?silos? and transferring data between them.

Our vision is to connect the enterprise web with easy-to-use software seamlessly integrated into the workflow of the modern knowledge worker. Our USP is created through our user experience and technology (e.g. Natural Language Processing).

ÿ

treev?s first product lets users find and share files across multiple cloud storage solutions like Dropbox, Google Drive and Box. It will be available as a browser plugin. Based on feedback and usage,we will iterate quickly and bring treev to other platforms such as mobile phones and tablets. Moreover, we plan to provide third party developers with the ""treevAPI"" so that they can integrate treev straight into their products.

ÿ

treev operates on a freemium model: knowledge workers use the product for free while business licenses (6?/month/user) drive revenue. The latter will include different benefits for businesses such as advanced security (e.g. hosting on own servers) and analytics (e.g. identification of experts among co-workers). Freemium is a proven business model for SaaS solutions. We expect revenues from open beta onwards (see financial plan). However, we do not expect to break even before 2017.

Our target audience contains customers and users. We have identified SMBs (e.g. Startups) using modern web apps like Gmail, Salesforce and Dropbox as our initial group of customers. In fact, such customers have proven to be willing to invest in solutions that make their employees more productive. Knowledge workers (e.g. sales reps) within such businesses are our target users. As proliferation of web apps reaches corporations, large businesses will be added to our customer group at a later stage.

TRIZORG.TV is an open platform for social interaction between elderly in care homes and their caregivers and relatives through TV and mobile applications resulting in monitoring and increasing mental health conditions.

ÿ

The purpose is:

To gather content supporting the mental wellbeing of the elderly from various sources (family and caregivers) towards one single medium the elderly is familiar to use: their TV set.
	Stimulate elderly in social web participation by using TV.
		Remotely connecting family with elderly relative.
		Maintaining/Increasing the mental health condition of the elderly.
	
ÿ

Ask the elderly about his/her well-being by having a personalized set of social oriented questions to get a better view of their mental conditions.
ÿ

To detect potential negative trends in their mental health condition by monitoring the usage of the content and the feedback/answers to the questions on a time scale.
	ÿ
ÿ

Elderly and their relative will like this solution as it stimulates elderly in social web participation and remotely connects the family.

ÿ

There is a great value for the home care organization: TRIZORG.TV prevents the elderly from being hospitalized outside the care center as potential aging issues caused by decreasing mental conditions can be detected early through the social interaction and treated proactively by fine-tuning the content.

ÿ

TRIZORG.TV supports the creation of a set of questions to be answered by the elderly through the TV channel using a simplified remote control. These answers are valuable data to detect trends in metal health conditions.

ÿ

Use cases:

People having mother/father staying in care homes can compose a personalized TV Channel with the content they like to share. This content can be video messages from them or a set of pictures of the grandchildren. This content will always make the elderly happy.
	One-to-one or many-to-one remote video calls from relatives to the elderly to celebrate a birthday.
	Caregivers offering a set of exercises videos for keeping the elderly both physically and mentally healthy.
	3th party content providers that publish videos helping in particular aging issues like dementia.
	Care homes publishing videos about the care center which makes to elderly more comforably : where to find what, what in case of emergency ?
ÿ

Another use case which makes the most value for the caregiver organizations.

Asking simple questions every day like ?how do you feel today? and reporting this over time gives a great insight in mental health evolution. This insight allows to help elderly proactive and avoid hospitalization caused by mental issues.

	Elaba! 2015 is a prototype bbbl app we wish to create using the bbblz framework, that will be launched at the 10 day-street festival ?Gentse Feesten? in Belgium, in July 2015
ÿ

USP of the bbblz framework

bbblz is an open-source framework for iOS and Android that you can use to create a unique popup social network app.ÿ

ÿ

Why would you want to use a bbbl?

That true digital ?summer camp feeling?

Everyone remembers that unique group of friends at their first summer camp and that unique atmosphere at the latest music festival. Today?s most popular digital social networks don?t reflect that ephemeral intensity and unique feeling of real life?s ?popup connections?.

A bbbl enables its users to digitally enhance the fun of an event or a community, since the popup network app digitally connects people who are physically together at the same time. While posting is only possible from within the party zone and during the duration of the event, reading &amp; commenting is possible from anywhere. Thus, a bbbl also allows those who can?t be there physically, to share the fun virtually.

ÿ

Share with those who care

With your best friend, you like to meet up at home, to share joys and sorrows. With the guys from the soccer team, you like to hang out at the pub &amp; share a few beers. Today?s social networks hardly allow users to make distinctions between these types of communication. Sharing your thoughts, activities, or feelings on Facebook or Twitter may feel as sharing your most intimate feelings with the guys from the soccer team. You get it: awkward?

When you share a post on a bbbl you know you share only with those who care. Every post you see on a bbbl will be related tot the specific atmosphere of the event, creating an enjoyable and unique feeling of togetherness.

ÿ

Live in the digital moment

When you visit a real life event, you might want to connect with people digitally as well, and share the fun. But do you, at the same time, want to read about global warming, and rising tax rates? Existing social networks make it hard to let go of the daily strains of life.

When you post in a bbbl, you stay in the momentum of the event or community. Every bbbl breathes the cultural history, typical characteristics &amp; unique atmosphere of the event or community it is made for. The user interface (UI) design suits the event?s design, the custom stories refer to the activities of the event, and the custom made stickers allow you to season your pictures with quotes in the typical slang or dialect of the event. ÿÿ

ÿ

Connect with the in-crowd 

Today?s social networks never just connect you with a specific group who?s gathered at the same time, at the same place, for the same real-life experience. Quick communication with this specific group through social networks is hard.

By integrating location services into the app, a bbbl allows the event?s organisers to communicate directly with their audiences through the visitors? smartphones. Organisers can advertise a happy hour to the people standing right in front of their bar. In case of emergencies, people in certain areas can quickly be notified to take the necessary actions.

ÿ

Our goal

Our goal is to build a prototype of the bbblz frontend framework and apply it to the development of the Elaba! prototype app, available for iOS and Android, during the 10 day-street festival ?Gentse Feesten? in Belgium, in July 2015. The Elaba! app will serve as an important use case and market validation for the bbblz framework.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

It allows participants to a.o. pick a date and location (a.o. using an API for Google Places) via an easy-to-use responsive online web tool based on the most recent web technologies. This one-stop-shop approach answered a pressing need to make planning an event more intuitive and straightforward. Traditionally, numerous to do-lists, phone calls, e-mails and so on, are frequently used to plan an event, creating a lot of ?communication overhead? thereby loosing focus on what really matters: having fun with your friends!

ÿ

Due to our increasingly hectic lifestyles, the aging population and the rising cost of health care, physical and mental health have become a booming business. Personal trainers are helping people to get fit, nutritionists are teaching everyone to respect a healthy diet, and people turn to psychologists to help them battle stress or depression.

Ready2improve is a Flemish SME that has built a business around this. It unites specialists from all of the aforementioned fields and more, to provide clients with an integrated solution for all their health coaching needs. Using techniques from motivational psychology, such as self-determination theory andÿ gamification, each client is provided with a custom and personalized face-to-face coaching experience to maximize their personal benefit. This approach has been successfully used by R2i for several years, not only for private persons, but also for companies aiming to improve the wellbeing of their employees.

ÿ

The problem

ÿ

However, this personalized approach also has downsides. Not only is it very time-consuming for the coaches to manage their users, the many-to-many relationship between coaches and clients (coaches will be assigned to many clients, but clients can also have multiple coaches, each with their own unique specialization) also creates a significant administrative overhead.

ÿ

In addition, the reliance on personal contact between coach and coachee means that users lack continuous feedback, and can only be guided during their infrequent (usually weekly) coaching sessions. This is especially problematic considering corrective feedback about undesirable behavior is most efficient when provided at the instant the undesirable behavior occurs.

ÿ

Our solution

ÿ

We want to tackle both of these problems at once by creating a unified web platform, to be used by coaches and coachees alike. We will gather relevant data from coachees using a variety of sensors, both general (smart phones and watches) and dedicated (fitness bracelets etc), filter and process this data and present it to the user in a comprehensible and clear format. Initially we will measure number of steps, active minutes, calorie intake and calories burned, heart rate, sleep patterns, and more, but this will be extended in the future as technology allows. At the same time, coaches can access the data of their clients and provide feedback accordingly, much faster and more accurately than they could before.

ÿ

For the coaches, the platform will also represent an all-in solution to their business needs: they can get an overview of all their clients; store personal notes about their clients and share them with other coaches or with clients; track invoices; send mails, articles, recipes or other useful info; manage their agendas; and more, all through a single piece of software that is accessible anywhere, at any time. All that?s required is an internet connection.

ÿ

For coachees, the platform will provide new ways of motivation for and engagement with managing their health. The availability of sensor-collected data and the more direct interaction with coaches are only the first step towards this goal. In the longer term, we will also include multiple full-blown health games about a variety of topics (movements, healthy eating, stress management, quitting smoking?) for interested users.

ÿ

Important to note is that the platform is not intended as a replacement for face-to-face coaching, but rather an extension of it. We strongly believe in a vision where health professionals are responsible for mentoring and motivating people to optimize their health, and we want to provide them with the tools to make that job easier.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Our clients are racing teams and tuners who want their car to win the race! They worked hard on their car and damage to it, must be avoided.

ÿ

RaceAlerts is an Internet of Things (IoT) service for racing teams that alerts the team when their car has an increased risk of getting damaged and losing the race or generating unforseen costs.
We collect live sensor data on our IoT platform and continuously monitor data and generate a variety of alerts to the user if values reach a critical point.

ÿ

In the BeNeLux, there are ? 200 semi-professional racing teams. They operate a few cars each and keeping them in best condition, is very important. Our market research has shown there is no service like RaceAlerts available for our target group. The existing systems aim for the professional racing teams with similar budget.

We aim to sell RaceAlerts to 50% of them (100 racing teams). They represent a first market of at least 374 000 EUR.

ÿ

During the 24h of Zolder, we performed a market research amongst potential clients (including teamchefs, teamowners) about RaceAlerts. All of them acknowledge there is no service like RaceAlerts.

Only datalogging products are available on the market. The team can download data when they have physical access to the car.

RaceAlerts sends its data wireless over existing m2m infrastructure to our cloud infrastructure.

ÿ

We developed 2 working prototypes and had them installed in cars of different racing teams during the Menzo 24h of Zolder. Both cars finished the race and gathered data. Together there are more than 500 000 datapoints that we visualised on multiple graphs. Nobody is interested in just the data. Only if there is an alert!

ÿ

Based on the experience with the prototype, we continue development of RaceAlerts, but also important, we already sold 2 RaceAlert systems. This year, we?d like to expand our network and build a list of leads, so we can boost sales. The first sales will be made by direct sale in the BeNeLux region, while we setup a website to do online sales. Furthermore, we are getting in contact with potential resellers.

ÿ

RaceAlerts was invented and developed by a team of 3 with a complementary set of skills. Eddy focussed on providing input on features and keeping contact with multiple racing teams. Toon designed and developed the platform, while Koen did project management and business development. On a regular basis we discussed progress with a connected racing team to make sure we are heading in the right direction. Recently, we got in touch with Wouter Moons to guide us on the business side of the project.

ÿ

At this moment, we invested 50 000 EUR to develop a working prototype. Now it?s time to take a step back and take a look at the bigger picture. We have to start thinking on further development of business around RaceAlerts. In the near future, we are looking for an operating line of 125 000 EUR to finance our first year. The biggest share of this budget is required to work on the business plan and encounter opportunities that will boost our sales. We estimate to sell RaceAlerts to 20 racing teams in our first year.

The service will be a desktop and mobile application.

It will curate the news based on the study of social interactions and on the personal business metrics of the user.

CONTEXT:

ÿ

More and more content is shared on social networks and it has become a challenge for media site to identify what kind of information will trigger high volumes of social interactions on their sites and on their social profiles.

ÿ

Facebook displays more proiminently what generates the more interactions per impression. To be visible in the NewsFeed, community managers must find engaging content to post.

ÿ

ÿ

Many tools now make it possible to know the performance of websites and their impact on the social networks (Google Analytics, Hootsuite, ...). They all have their limitations per platform or per number of sources and we decided to go further with Graphystories.ÿ

OUR SOLUTION

ÿ

Graphystories is a new tool that analyzes the news and their social ranking. It performs the intelligent analysis of large volumes of data from leading media sites and social networks.ÿ

ÿ

With real-time monitoring of the main sites and media facebook pages, the tool notifies content creators of topics and provides related articles that have attracted most social networks. It analyzes in parallel the most frequently typed words on search engines and crossed them with the already written articles.ÿIt shows on what theme and on which topic to be the first to publish an article.

ÿ

Graphystories analyzes the impact of social interactions of media websites.ÿA predefined list of sites is provided by our tool. This is not exhaustive, there will be the possibility of adding any other domain or RSS feed. Graphystories allows users to sort the stories posted by date and social ranking (like, share,etc.) for better discovery.

ÿ

Graphystories allows information monitoring:

Graphystories allows users to access all the subjects that make the buzz on the internet. Sorting can be done based on the date of the article, its category (sports, general news ...) or on the type of interaction. Our tool combines data from Google Trends to suggest keywords than can help our customers increase their visibility in the Google News Search index.

Everyday more than 100 million photos are made. All those content is spread across the Internet. The challenge for a consumer is to keep track of all the online content containing great memories. People are looking for ways to collect all this content back at one place to relive these memories and to share it with family and friends, both in the digital and physical world. The best way to share a collection of the best memories is a photo book. Therefore the photo book market is a big growing market worldwide. For example it is a billion euro market in both Western Europe and The United States. Creating a photo book is quite a hassle. Besides the creation steps for making a photo book are too complicated, the biggest problem is it takes you several days to gather all the photos out of all the different data sources and afterwards selecting your best moments out of this. This is not the only problem consumers are facing when making photo books, but also when they just want to gather all their online moments and relive and share the best ones.

ÿ

More abstract it can be stated that there are three major problems/challenges when making (tangible) personalized products out of big data:

1.ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ Gather all the content out of several big data sources

2.ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ Select the best content out of big data

3.ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ Transform this selection into an online experience, which can also be ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ printed/tangalized.

An extra challenge is to do the three things below, within a short amount of time.

ÿ

ReSnap is going to develop the perfect solution for these three challenges, using the newest deep learning and machine learning techniques. ReSnap will give a new dimension at creating and sharing (online) photo stories and the creation of photo albums will never be a problem anymore. Users will never need to spend time with gathering all the photos out of all the data sources anymore, nor with selecting the best ones.

ÿ

The service that we will offer, will be the perfect way to gather all you best online moments and store and share them in a new way of an online photo story, which also can be ordered in a tangible product. ReSnap will be the solution, because our selection algorithms can always select the best content within 1 minute and place it in an online photo story perfectly. This means that social media will not be the only data source the system will use, but the system will also be able to select the best 100 pictures out of (for example) 1000 on every desired data source like desktop or mobile.

ÿ

The smart selection can be done through the use of a neural networks and the newest deep learning and machine learning techniques. Because of this services, the ReSnap tool will be the smartest photo tool there is. This is the service, which we will develop during this project.

Airshow is anÿonline platform for managing realtime challenges.ÿÿIt enables content creators to publish challenges, moderate the contributions and feed the results back to any medium.ÿ

ÿ

Goalÿ

We want to create good-looking, responsive interactions. Content creators don't want to code and spend time perfecting the user experience. We've done the hard part. Our experiences adapt to all devices, work on Facebook, as an interactive Twitter card or on the creators' website. We provide the tools for the content creators to add challenges, moderate them and visualize the results on any medium (TV, app, social networks, websites...). We provide them with the necessary metrics to analyze the results of their challenges.ÿ

ÿ

Problemÿ

Currentlyÿcontent creators, broadcasters, retailers and brands produce custom apps. This introduces the following problems:

This custom solution isn't cost efficient and offers limited ROI
	Budget and time limits result in half-baked apps
	User participation is limited, unless good challenges are called for
	The apps are hardly ever integrated with existing content platformsÿ
	ÿ
Solution

ÿ

1. Content creators can choose from a selection of rich interactive challenges that can be quickly published to any online platformÿ

2. They can track all user contributions in realtime with powerful moderator tools that can manage thousands of challenge contributions in realtime.

3. The content creator can visualize the best challenge contributions on-air (eg. live TV-show) , on smart TV's, on their apps, social networks or websites.ÿ

4. Every challenge is carefully monitored and generates realtime metrics and insights so content producers can immediately analyze the impact of their challenges

5. Based on the impact insights, the concept of the challenges can be tweaked for upcoming content.ÿ

6.ÿContributions can also be disclosed within the client's apps, social networks or websites, thus generating brand loyalty and user retention

ÿ

The amount of challenge widgets are endless and we want to provide they best for different kinds of formats. Widgets could be categorized into a matrix defined byÿ

ÿ

Functionality. E.g. creative challenges, social challenges, monetization challenge, educational challenges...
	Type of event. E.g. ÿa live TV/radio broadcast, ÿconferences, brand campaigns, live sporting events...
	Timing.ÿE.g. triggering challenges before, during or after content consumption.ÿ
	Devices. E.g. tablets, smartphones, TV studio's, cars, smartwatches...
ÿ

Business Planÿ

We're targeting a B2B market of content creators worldwide. We're looking at monthly subscription plans that are based on the number of contributions and a selection of advanced features.ÿ

ÿ

Problemÿ

Content creators are losing market share to innovative companies, monetizing the over-the-top experiences. Our solution helps broadcasters, brands and educational institutions to transform to great content creators online. They will be able to create quiz formats that are interactive by nature.ÿ
	Content creators would be able to create a custom solution but thisÿwouldn't be cost efficient and would offer limited ROI.

ÿ

Content creators can schedule and broadcast their live Quiz shows. They can create a gameflow that matches their own format. ÿ
	Viewers can really become part of the show as they compete live against each other every day.ÿ
	The content creator can integrate the actions of his users immediately in his content

Partnerships with international content production houses, who specialise in selling media formatsÿ

ÿ

Competition
Although there are several interactive quiz game makers, there is no service platform that would enable content creators to jump on this new wave of content engagement online.ÿ
Although we see existing companies (Applicater, Zentrick) offering similar tools, they are not focused on Quiz formats.

ÿ

MagicWander makes it easy to create and share 3D navigable snapshots of real-world spaces.

ÿ

I will offer a content creation tool that enables people to photograph indoor or outdoor spaces and share them with other people as 3D online experiences. Spaces are captured by taking pictures with smartphones and consumer cameras. These pictures are then automatically processed into a 3D representation that can be explored using a mobile or desktop device by the end-user.ÿ

ÿ

The end-user?s experience is contained in aÿso-called ?viewer? which is similar to an online video player like YouTube?s. The viewer can be embedded and shared in web and mobile environments and even in virtual reality (VR) applications. The end-user will be able to navigate through the captured space by moving and looking in all directions. The experience will inherently be photo-realistic because everything is based on photographs, yet rendered smartly to give a 3D impression.ÿ

ÿ

MagicWander will enable people to effectively convey what a real-world scene or environment looks and feels like through an online experience, and it will serve as an interactive platform for novel commercial applications that is more engaging than existing ones.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

WorkAnyWhere is a platform allowing companies to rent office space for their commuting employees by the hour, day, week, month or year from other parties with excess office space. These other parties are companies, public venues or residential consumers.

ÿ

In the current model employees typically have two locations to work from: at home or at their company's offices. Both locations have (dis)advantages of their own. WorkAnyWhere will combine the best aspects of both locations and make work more efficient, fun and easy. This benefits the employee (work-life balance, happiness) and the company (productiveness, cost efficiency).

The platform allows employees to find a professional office space close(r) to home without being ""home alone"". Employees living closer to each other than to the company's offices can arrange meetings at meeting rooms on the WorkAnyWhere platform. This allows mixing with employees from other companies (through networking) at these WorkAnyWhere spaces, reducing commuting times and avoiding suboptimal working at home.

ÿ

Companies or individuals with excess space can rent out those spaces to WorkAnyWhere users, generating new revenue, optimizing office space costs and enabling networking with other companies and industries.

ÿ

Memory... Processing power... Bandwidth... It is the same for our personal computers...We only use 10% of their potential. So it's time to change the paradigm.ÿWe aim at bulding a cloud based infrastructure using millions of personal computers (and later mobile devices) as nodes instead of servers... this is what we call, the social cloud ! A huge potential unused yet !

ÿ

How can the social cloud helps the creative industry ?

ÿ

The goal of the social cloud is to share and monetize unused resources.ÿToday's rendering issues costs a lot of time to creative studios (videogame, motionmakers, 3D). Most of the time, they outsource these jobs to rendering farms or cloud services (i.e. huge data centers), working as supercomputers dedicated to rendering. It's complicated it can take time and it's expensive !

ÿ

We can make it easier, faster and cheaper

ÿ

Our prototype will offer a plugin for the famous opensource software Blender3D (Shrek, Spiderman 2,...), but we can later develop solutions for video editing softwares such as Adobe After Effects and many more. Our ultimate goal ? To implement our service directly in the operating systems? Our solution can provide additional resource for any creative company in need. Because everyone is connected, any potential customer may also be a potential ressource.ÿ

ÿ

How does it work ?

ÿ

Cloud technology allows to dispatch any calculation job (render is one among many others) through several different clusters of machines. Most of the cloud solutions are server based clusters, let?s create PC based clusters !ÿ

First step, we need potential nodes to monitor their computer in order to measure their unused resources, we have a á version software for that purpose : GURU MONITOR. GURU stands for Global Unused Resources Unit.

Second, we monitor potential nodes for 30 days in order to establish a global ranking. Selected nodes are invited to instal our VM on their computers?so we can use them as effective nodes? later we will distribute a secured encryption USB device for security purpose.

Third, all the shared ressources are measured and can be monetized, but they also can be exchanged with consumed ones. It is a virtuous circle.

I want to develop an easy to use 3D modelling software so people can use it to print their own ideas in 3D. The website is online at http://www.makeyour3dshape.com

ÿ

This is not the kind of service you use everyday, so you can't afford to learn the software every time you want to use it. There are two main ideas. You can draw freely as if you were in a regular 2D paint program. You can also import svg files to use the curves as constraints. For example you can create your logo from 2D to 3D in a few minutes. And finally you can choose to print on-line, or download the file on your computer.

ÿ

Customer problemÿ:

ÿ

There are tools for people to customize objects prepared by designers. But when people come with their ideas, they don't have a lot of choices. They need to learn a complicated software. In the main approach used by on-line service, they need to learn how to create primitives, do boolean operations, and do extrusions. It's too complicated for people who are new to 3D modelling.

ÿ

Product or service that you will offerÿ:

ÿ

The main service is the 3d modelling software. Around that, we will offer some private account to save projects, and to share a user gallery. User will learn the service using an extensive set of interactive tutorials.

ÿ

Target market / customers :

ÿ

The business is clearly B2C. The main target is 3D first time users. They have never used 3d software, and they want to use the power of 3D printers.

ÿ

Sales &amp; marketing strategy :

ÿ

I need to go to FabLabs, where people are already interested in 3D printing. I want to go to schools, to cultural associations, and 3D printing events.

ÿ

Business model :

ÿ

The user is free to create objects and use all the provided tools. He will pay only when he prints, or downloads the 3D object file. With on-line 3D printers like sculpteo.com, you can get a percentage fee on every object printed from your account.

ÿ

Competitors :

ÿ

www.tinkercad.com From Autodesk, this is the most intuitive on-line service right now.

www.leopoly.com They have exactly the same goal, but they used other ergonomics.

www.jewel.com They also imagined a new way to create 3D objects. They are jewelry oriented.

ÿ

Competitive advantage :

ÿ

My advantage is about software development. I can use any research paper on algorithms, every time there is a user request. I'm also the backend developer, so prototypes can be brought on-line very quickly.

ÿ

Challenges and risks :

ÿ

Business is based on a new user interface. It may not fit the users expectations. The challenge is to adapt to the feedback very quickly. And finally you can't patent ergonomics, so the idea can be easily stolen.

ÿ

Management of the team :

ÿ

Empower &amp; unlock the power of communities through collaboration, co-creation, crowd funding &amp; crowdsourcing.

ÿ

Description

Communities &amp; interest groups have become popular the last few years. Lots of people investÿa largeÿpart of their free timeÿto connect with like-mindedÿpeople, to learn, to networkÿ&amp; to co-create.ÿ

A lot of theseÿinitiatives have found their way to social media sites like Facebook orÿgeneral-purposeÿmeetÿup sites like Meetup.com or Groupspaces, butÿmostÿrun against the limits of these platforms, resulting in:


	The misuseÿof the platform
	
	
	Use of separate online tools lacking any integrationÿbetween them.ÿ
	
These inefficiencies lead to communities failing to reach their full potential. It is a pain we, as founders of the IoTBE user group, are confronted with every day.ÿ

ÿ

How will the C? platform empower communities?

ÿ

A platform for the community.

C? recognizes the true nature of the community. Instead of offering a general purpose, one-size fits all web CMS with community features, we incorporate the needs of the different community stakeholders in the core of the platform. Running a community is a lot like running an enterprise and therefor needs the appropriate tools, like a public website, a member intranet site, voting systems, e-commerce, task management, inventory management, sponsor management, ... .

Different types of communities needs different tools. Each community will be able to choose which tools to use. Community templates will be provided to ease this process. If the other (online) tools are already in use, integration will be made possible through the C? API?s.

ÿ

A platform by the community.

We will build a community SaaS platform that will be extensible through an app store. Apps ? widgets, applications, services, integrations ? will be built by development communities in close collaboration with the end-user community of the apps. The collaboration could be initiated through crowd funding allowing the ?financial sponsor? to take up its role as end user in vertical open innovation trajectory.

ÿ

A community of communities

Communities need collaboration more &amp; more in order to achieve their goals. C? will provide communities with the dedicated tools to support different kinds of collaboration in a structured manner (in contrast to current internal messaging systems or email).

Communities will be able to link with each other and in the process share (give access to) their resources (news, calendar, events, ?) and overlay them with their own.

Collaboration goes one step further than sharing. During collaboration, two or more communities will be able to setup a dedicated collaboration space (= collaboration community) to execute their common activities. E.g.:


	Organizing events together and distribute the revenue and cost among participating communities.
	
	
	Start-ups could create a user community or developer community around their product.
	
	
	Innovative companies that lack specific skills to develop their idea could setup a crowd sourcing collaboration for creative companies to join.
	
These collaboration tools will empower communities both towards reaching their goals as well as support them financially.

ÿ

The platform as a community

All users participating in a C? community become part of the global C? community. C? will engage its user base through gamification. This user base will form the basis for bringing communities together. Collaboration between communities will also be stimulated by introducing communities with one another by means of a recommendation engine. Matches would be found based on the type of community, its goals, its members &amp; their interest and the activities of the community.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

In particular, users can create events based on creative activities (e.g. social activities, sports, fun &amp; entertainment), look for participants or invite friends, but also manage and share content created during the events; e.g. photos that people captured, comments or relative digital content that they would like to remember. At the end of each event, they can rate the event, promoting the organizer of the event to a trusted, well-known event organizer. The goal of the service is to help people living in urban areas become more open, meet people with similar interests and organize better sharing content under a similar event. Abareza leverages the lack of communities organizing &amp; sharing events outside the strict management of companies, groups and agents. It can be described alternatively as ?a Spotify for events?, where people will find the most interesting events in proximity, based on their mood and interests. Abareza has a multi-segment business model; customers for the free service and premium accounts, while businesses can promote their events through the platform. Basic customers can create and look for events based on activities of their interest get recommended events, invite friends or allow strangers to join them, and become reputed hosts. Premium accounts with monthly subscription will be introduced and will allow participants to use advanced features in their events and become reputed event organizers. In parallel, affiliated marketing will be used to allow business accounts to promote events in broader geographical areas and get visibility through the main page of the service. Abareza would be positioned in multiple markets, as it is both an event-planning platform that allows not only users but also companies to create and promote events, and a community of users who create and share content. The focus is on the social media industry, as Abareza at its current form is primarily considered a user-generated content-based platform. Even if Facebook is the central point of reference when it comes for users? identity, many youth users turn into new networks that look fresh, are mobile based and provide more engaging characteristics, like Snapchat or Instagram, or they focus on chatting applications, like WhatsApp. This trend towards new services has created a new opportunity in mobile, social services; we expect the mobile advertising market to more than double during the next two years and to increase twelvefold by 2015 to $20.6 billion worldwide, while revenue generated by consumer location-based services is forecast to reach $13.5 billion in 2015. On the other hand, the market of social events looks quite stable, with companies like Meetup, Eventora and Eventbrite focusing on groups and organizations rather than end-users to organize and run events. We plan to reach our customers through dedicated campaigns on existing social media platforms and mobile marketplaces. Social accounts will be used to sign up to the platform and share messages towards friends of existing users, in order to invite them to the platform. When the application is out as a beta version, we will target technology magazines and blogs, such as TechCrunch, Wired, Mashable, Co.Design, but also well-known bloggers while communities conducting events will be invited onboard. All these community-building techniques will be supported with continuous social, posting blog posts and promoted messages in Facebook and Google Ads.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Talentina is an eBay for online coaching, with Skype-like video sessions that the client can replay in the cloud.
	With our public platform prototype, our team proves to master FIWARE technology such as Kurento.
	However, to have a direct impact on this ? 2.5B market with 5% growth, organizations ask us to provide their own instant, private coaching platforms.
	Because this is an innovative cloud solution, with no set-up for the client, we must overcome 3 key issues: (1) security, (2) scalability and (3) usability.
	The FIWARE cloud and technology give us access to this, such as locally stored data (vs. AWS).
	We aim to support FIWARE's success this way.
ÿ

Platform

Our team builds a social marketplace that makes coaching more accessible, because it makes the value of a Coaching Session more transparent. This helps to increase the 5% growth in this part of the Creative Industry.

ÿ

That is why we have built an advanced prototype of a public marketplace (web + app) that brings online coaching at your fingertips. Talentina is an ""eBay for online coaching, with Skype and cloud recording of Coaching Sessions built into it"". This prototype is entirely self-financed, and tested with Coaches and Clients (see video).

ÿ

Through our sales efforts, we discovered that we must allow organizations to run instant, private marketplaces (as instances of our platform) in the cloud. Big clients like VDAB want this. With FIWARE, we can build it, while we continue to grow our public platform as-is.

ÿ

This allows those private marketplaces to:

active and scale up automatically with FIWARE technology,
	securely share sensitive data, on the FIWARE cloud based in the EU,
	provide 'accessibility for life' to (ex-)employees via the public platform through advanced FIWARE technology, such as Access Control and ID Mgt.
ÿ

With FIWARE technology and our participation in the FIWARE network, we can unlock these 'coaching silos'.

ÿ

Market

ÿ

The Personal Coaching business is a ? 2.4 billion market that is growing at more than 5% per year, according to PWC.

However, the growth is hampered by a lack of transaparency with privacy,
	Online competitors like Google Helpouts or Skype do not provide this,
	eBay shows that a social marketplace creates new jobs (like Talentina), as it provides transparency to a given market.
ÿ

Our business model gives Coaches free access in return for a Success Fee of 13,8%. We deliver free quality leads for a 20' online sales pitch, because the Client pays us ? 9,99. Clients pay to record a Session.

ÿ

With the serious challenges to the economy in Europe, personal coaching provides a solid answer to significant changes in society.

Coaching does create more growth in the fast changing economy, directly and indirectly, as well-trained employees who also receive coaching increase their future employment chances.

(Source: McInness and Ozturk (2007): Predicting Employment Effects of Job Coaching)

ÿ

The stimulus to the economy is also direct, by helping Coaches:

creating more jobs for Coaches,
	increasing the yield by filling the available coaching slots (towards full-time employment), and,
	increasing the income, reflecting the real value added.
ÿ

Indirectly, coaching stimulates our economy and helps to create better bonds in society, when individuals learn to grow and become more cost effective.

ÿ

Conclusion

ÿ

By making coaching instantly accessible, our platform creates real value that has a direct impact on society. Our team has proven it masters technology such as FIWARE Kurento, by building an advanced prototype. As such, we will enrich the success of the FIWARE community.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

A pan-European aggregation platform for hyper-local citizen journalism, run completely as a user-driven social news network.
In this way, we decentralise information and democratise news on a micro level, engaging local communities and fostering knowledge- and information sharing across Europe. We facilitate aÿtransnational cultural, social, political, business etc. awareness and understanding, while giving access to on-the-ground information by local people.
At the same time, we are a virtual lab for testing new disruptive revenue-sharing business models, and by incorporating technology as a fundament for online democracy, we truly differentiate to be more than a ?news media?.

ÿ

Concept

For end users (news consumers), the platform is intended to quickly and effortlessly keep up to date with local European news, where, when and in what shape they desire. News content can be sorted according to Topic, Location and Popular. Browsing by Location opens a heat-map showing areas of high activity, as well as amount of content creators by region. News consumers are encouraged to participate in creation, augmentation and sharing of news, as well as securing quality and relevance of the content. End users can source accurate traceable information from a broad range of local medias, completely personalised, depending on interest of place and topics, while deciding in a democratic way, how to shape the interface and divide the revenues.

ÿ

For content creators (Local news media, freelance journalists, local activists, NGOs, bloggers, regular people etc), making a profile to contribute to the news information flow and have their voice and cases heard, will never have been easier. Geo-location based news content can be text, pictures, videos, and podcasts and live streaming.

ÿ

The site is designed across all devices, and we will follow up with an app, to make content creation a smooth and seamless activity. All original material is added on the content creators profile, as well as shown on the front page in chronological order, and sorted according to the consumers selection of Topic, Location and Popular.

ÿ

Content creators can also be local government, organisations and businesses, see business model chapter.

ÿ

Why

News and media are among the most disrupted industries, but the sector is increasingly centralised, and big news corporations are monopolising the information we receive, in a product dominant logic, rather than a service dominant logic of mutual inclusion and co-creation. While the music and movie industry is adapting to the new technological landscape and investigating new business models, journalism and newsvendors are still clinging on to bygone models. This results in a non-flexible up-down approach and rigid one-way communication flow. Paradoxically, many online news outlets have an engaged community of readers (ready to comment, augment, like and share their content), whose contribution would be considered invaluable for other more agile private businesses.

The traditional press have neither the resources nor the knowledge to cover the micro challenges of local communities. They are reporting on global geo-political issues, often exclusively with an Anglo-Saxon angle, ignoring the smaller regions within Europe, thus neglecting one of the essential European values, that of diversity and freethinking. In this manner, lots of important local information never leave their region, resulting in news consumers not being able to see and connect international trends, movements and ideas, not getting the big picture. Local people and press will also usually be first on the spot of interest, offering exclusive breaking news content before it is news.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

important documents like birth certificate, medical documents, school reports, diploma?s, vaccinations etc.

There will be a public and a secure part. Once a year, before his or her birth- day a book will be proposed with allÿthe content

that was saved and will be automatically layouted in chronological order. ÿ

One can get that book in physical form and collect all 13 volumes as a precious gift for the child.

13 is the legal age where one can open a social account.

Then he can choose to keep the other admins or assign new ones like his friends and become an admin on his friends pages too.

Because TAM has a qualitative audience, advertisers can target with precision with meaningful messages.

Pampers, Zwitsal, toys, baby-food, clothing. ÿ

But because the TAM page has many admins, they also will be receptive to well targeted ads.ÿ

ÿ

There will be a free version, which will allow to use the base functionalities and to upload a minimum set of photo?s, for example about 20 photo?s.

For an annual subscription fee of 30? the main admin can invite 10 admins which can upload a high amount of photos, video?s, ... ÿ

The book

Every year the admin(s) can buy a book containing in chronological order the highlights of the year.

The admin(s) can edit the book as he (they) pleases. ÿThe book will be sold at normal competitive prices.ÿ

A memory network

?A new way to mark moments in time.

ÿNever lose any important document anymore like birth-certificate, blood-type, school diploma?s, immunizations, medical records etc...ÿ

?Keep track of all his school mates and later he will be able to contact them at his convenience when he feels up to it.

?Make him discover where he came from. Who his parents were, his grand parents, his uncles and nieces...

?Connect with people around the world with the same name as your godchild.

?Or were born on the same day, the same minute, second. Wherever around the world. and be able to track them via Google earth.

?Don?t be alone to archive. Invite up to 10 admin?s like grand parents, godparents, uncles, nieces, sisters, brothers orfriendstohelparchiveasmuchas they want for their godchild.

?The archiving part being completely private and secure there will also be a public area where anyone can choose for themselves what they want to share.

?Once 13 your child inherits the whole lot!

?After he recovered from his emotions receiving the 13 volumes of his life in 13 books he becomes the sole administrator.

ÿFor him to choose to keep some as fellow admin?s or not.
?And this is where he can start his own precious intimate social network. Inviting close friends to continue keeping track of his whereabouts.

The goal is the monetizing of this service and the acceleration and better monetization of 3D assets for our clients and the entertainment industry as a whole.

ÿ

The concept:

The idea started from a clear need to enhance interoperability between traditional media production and the converging media production. This need has become clear to us in collaborating with many clients within the film, animation and advertising industry. One of our clients defines this need as follows:

ÿ

&lt;The media industry is looking for new revenue models better adapted to ?the age of free? and the ?screen-hopping generation?. Transmedia, releasing content across media, is a powerful way to generate additional income ... how they can best be exploited and how they can be developed in the most cost-efficient way, both technologically and creatively? &gt;

ÿ

AtEx aims to greatly reduce the existing barrier between 3D Design packages, multi platform game engines and HTML5 WebGL based solutions. This will result in either a web based service (FIWARE enabled) or a combination of a web based service with stand alone plug-ins. We are certain that this prototyping phase will give us the necessary insights to decide on the final marketable form of our solution.

ÿ

The customers problem:

The media industry is challenged ÿto answer the increasing need of consumers as they are getting more used and demanding to consume content anywhere, anytime and anyhow.

But the content?s adapation to enable a max of benefit from all types of media consumption, increases the cost of that adaptation. Well adapted content sells better, but comes to a higher cost. Adapting content is a creative challenge, decreasing the cost a technical one. In fact, lowering the technical cost enables a higher ROI and releases more budget for creative development of content. It is exactly this need we are trying to resolve with AtEx.

On a technical and operational level we can identify the problems as follows.

Game developers and 3D artists have issues achieving proper interoperability of 3D sets/scenes between 3D Design packages and game engines. As for simple objects the interoperability is almost guaranteed, for complex scenes there still is an issue:

e.g : typical headache: http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/158164/unity-importing-instances-wrong-via-fbx.html

ÿ

As a Movie and Animation Studio, we are often asked to deliver 3D assets to gaming companies. Currently we are working closely together with a gaming company on a couple of projects. We encounter a lot of issues while trying to transfer our 3D scenes seamlessly into a 3D game engine (Unity or WebGL). These issues take time to be resolved and consume consequently a lot of money.

ÿ

This is not only an expensive process for our clients (Game and Film producers) but also for the directors of the production companies and the creative directors at studios around the world.

Therefore the ?added value? we offer answers the need from an international and dynamic market, open to innovative approaches.

Possible Clients and competitive advantage:

The possible clients for our service are producers, post-production/game companies and app developers. Our software considerably improves the workflow between these parties. It allows them to connect the different software they use and synchronize their workflows. It even helps to build a bridge between the cultures of game development and audiovisual post-production.

SpeedView uses image processing techniques to calculate the velocity of passing vehicles. In doing so, its approach is radically different from the classical techniques of calculating vehicle velocity, which are based on radar or induction loops that are embedded in the road surface. ÿ

ÿ

The change in technology alone will reduce the product cost of speed detection systems. But SpeedView goes even a step further in cost reduction by making the device fully autonomous with regards to power supply and data transmission.ÿ By coupling the device with a high yield solar panel, the SpeedView camera no longer requires any connection with the power grid.ÿ SpeedView sends it captured data to a central platform using a mobile data connection. That way, no physical connection to a transmission grid is needed. ÿ This autonomy makes it very easy to quickly install SpeedView cameras and maintain them with little effort.ÿ

ÿ

Combining the use of image processing with the autonomy of the camera is the reason we believe that with SpeedView it is possible to reduce the total cost of ownership by a factor 10. This will be a huge deal for local and federal police departments. For them it means that for the price of 1 classical speed detector, they can now monitor 10 places in a flexible way with a SpeedView camera.

ÿ

Our ambition is to grow this innovation beyond speed detection alone. We are firm believers in open systems and as soon as the first results are promising, we will open up our platform to other developers. That way, SpeedView cameras can be used for various other applications such as the monitoring of dangerous crossings, theft prevention, smart parking, ....ÿ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Imagine the huge multiplayer interaction one can find in online text-based games combined with smooth graphix and strategic gameplay from games as Age of Empires? and Civilization?: the result is the massive online multiplayer strategy game called Cities of Faith.ÿ

Cities of Faith, or CoF, is an online multiplayer game combining the best elements of strategy, adventure and politics. In this game of conquest, players employ strategic and tactical skills to command troops in capturing vital locations and defeating enemies. One must try their very best to stand their ground in worlds with over 200 other human players. You can join your friends by creating alliances and unite them within your everlasting empire...

ÿ

HISTORY
CoF is the result of the combined effort of two engineers. During the past year they conceived the gameplay ideas behind Cities of Faith and drafted conceptual mockups and graphics. ÿ

ÿ

COMMERCIALIZATION
Playing CoF is free. No monthly subscription fee or other payment is required. The frequent player on the other hand, has the opportunity to purchase credits via micro-payments, allowing him to access more features. For an estimated 3 to 5 EUR, ÿone receives 1000 credits, a sufficient amount for an average player to last a month.

ÿ

COMMERCIAL PLAN
CoF targets gamers between the age of 10 and 35. That group can be subdivided in hardcore and casual gamers. The commercialization of CoF proceeds in two phases. The first phase targets the hardcore gamers by posting messages on specialized gaming forums and communities. That should provide CoF with a stable base of frequent players. To further enlarge the user base, casual gamers are targetted using Google Ads? and advertisement in online public places like Facebook?. Along with all this, mouth-to-mouth commercialization attributes its part in providing CoF with fresh players.

ÿ

STRENGTHS &amp; OPPORTUNITIES
1) ÿ unique in its genre: massive multiplayer combined with solid strategic gameplay
2) ÿ runs on both Windows?, Mac OS X? and Linux? ÿthanks to Java? technology
3) ÿ high profit opportunity, profit per player is much larger than the cost per player
4) ÿ initial investement cost is very low, because of the online nature
5) ÿ the game is in English and is suited for an international community
6) ÿ management of CoF is fully automated: registration, billing, game control, servers,...
7) ÿ people nowadays are more inclined to buy through use of micro-payments
8) ÿ more and more people are interested in online gaming

ÿ

RISKS &amp; THREATS
1) ÿ pioneering a new game genre has an implicit risk
2) ÿ a sufficient amount of paying players is required to be financially self-sustaining
3) ÿ game complexity may negatively affect the joining of new players
4) ÿ the game itself is required to remaining challenging for experienced players

ÿ

Problem 

1. Selling tickets

Small and medium sized events have a very ad-hoc way of selling tickets

often just via email: ?order your tickets at john.doe@skynet.com?
	tickets are sold through intermediaries (i.e. members, affiliates,... of the organizer)
	payments need to be re-collect from intermediaries
	effectiveness of intermediaries varies
ÿ

2. Access control

Getting your tickets and controlling access is often messy

a single excel file that has to be checked for names
	many envelopes containing tickets laying at the reception which have to be searched
	who already paid and who did not?
	at the door tickets are often not added to that excel...
In general: no complete overview of all ordered tickets

ÿ

3. Reporting back

The event went well ... or not?

incomplete information on how many tickets were sold in totalÿ(at which stage, what time and the kind of ticket)
	no metric information on how to do better next event
	no centralized mailing database
In general: lack of information makes ineffective organization for next event

ÿ

By using the SaaS, users of the app do not have to come to a user experience or usability lab anymore where they are given scenarios telling them what to do with the software.ÿBut they can rather use the application by themselves, on their own device and in their own natural environment. The solution provides product teams an app library that they can just plug into their app and capture the user's screen, the interactions with the app and the end user behind the screen using the front-facing camera of the smartphone, tablet or even laptop. Product teams don't have to setup an expensive usability lab anymore with specialized hard- and software, which is also very intrusive to use by the user. See usability lab of Center of User Experience Design in Leuven.

ÿ

The product team of the app can just follow remotely in real-time what the user is doing with the app, where they encounter problems and how they feel about the app just by looking at their facial expressions and their verbal and body language. Product teams can remotely follow what their users are doing on the screen, hear what they are saying and even see their reactions. In the meanwhile they can make notes that are added to the video stream which will help them at a later time e.g. to replay problematic parts of the session to better understand what happened and how they could eventually improve the design of the app. The product team members who are observing can even use chat to discus or even consult with each other what is going on. When they want they can even use the voice channel to interact with the user to even better understand why she is using the app the way she does or can even help her when she is completely stuck in the app and does not even know anymore what to do.

ÿ

Every session will be recorded and made ready for replay afterwards, not only showing the recorded screen and audio and video but also visualizing the different interactions and problems the user encountered during the session as well as the notes the observers made while following.

ÿ

Even after all usability tests are performed and the app is put into production, the service could still be used by the customer service department to interact with users who have problems with the app. When users need help they could start the service itself which will contact customer service and the user could show customer service what they are trying to do with the app and where they have problems are get stuck. Customer service on their side can just see in their web browser the screencast of what the user is doing with app and in the meanwhile hear the users explanation and see their facial expressions. Customer service can then just use the audio channel to guide the user through the app.

One aspect of the recruiting process has not changed at all: the job description. Marketers realised long-ago that video is far more memorable and emotionally engaging.

Vicancy is changing the future of job advertising. We boost job postings using animated video job ads on the largest professional network - LinkedIn. This helps companies and recruiters to stand out, get their message across and improve their employer branding in order to recruit the best talent. So far we have clients all over the world ranging from innovative SME?s to multinationals such as Ahold, SCA and HP.ÿOur animation software gives us the benefits of online video (visibility, engagement, branding &amp; conversion) without the delivery time and costs of production. We turn text based jobs into a customised video ads within 24 hours including a target linkedIn campaign for ?479. ÿ

ÿ

Currently we grow at around 30% in sales month over month. Taking the projections into account it seems that within half a year we will be reaching a considerable volume of around 250 video job ads per month. This scale puts us in a position where the current distinctiveness of the ads will not be sufficient anymore.ÿIn order to avoid the commoditization of our product we aim to choose the same strategy as a company called Envato.

ÿ


	Marketplace for both third party content providers ÿ
	
	
	Interface where recruiters can easily fill out their job posting
	
	
	Automated cloud rendering of job animations (30 seconds

As a result in the end of July 2015 with the help of freelance animators we will be able to set the standard regarding to quality of video job ads and avoid commoditization of our product.

Dublin Dublin, Ireland",Horizontal (solutions suitable for every verticals),B2B,5,2,YES,IN,Frederic Herrera,"Videobot wants to develop a mobile video playback/recording app for festivals and conferences. Such white-label technology solution for both festival and conference organizers increase engagement before, during and beyond festivals and conferences. Engagement via Videobot app will be designed and centered on videos enabled by the app itself: interviews sponsored by event organizers, user-generated videos from music fans and conference attendees (comments, opinions, video logs, questions to artists/speakers), archive videos from past festivals and conferences, related videos from social networks (facebook, twitter, instagram, linked in,...)


The Videobot video app brings the following benefits to festival and conference organizers: 1. Development of online and mobile audience for festival and conference organizers that can be monetized via paid premium advert insertions in curated user-generated video recordings and video views. 2. Development of fan base for artists and community for conference speakers.

ÿ

The Video app proposed as part of this Creati FI call for prototypes will be a fully-configurable app (visual design and features-set) for iOS, Android and Windows smartphones and tablets. The video app will be enabled by Videobot white-label Content Management System (CMS) - VBOT - that is currently used by the EU Best Practice Network Europeana Space to linked video archives to smart tv applications in real-time. The proposed video app for festivals and conferences will use FI-WARE generic enablers in regards to user authorizations and streaming services and overlay insertions making the the viewing experience more engaging and interactive standard video streams to smartphones and tablets.

ÿ

The app prototyped in this proposal addresses the following problems for the clients: 1. Easy to use technology solution that doesnt need an in-house technical team for installation, 2. Technology solution that can be scaled based on the number of recording/views and priced accordingly for most festival and conference organizers, 3. Detailed reporting on how the app is used before, during and beyond events so that organizers can monetize the app and its content via a sponsored or subscription model.

ÿ

The target market for Videobot mobile video recording app for festivals and conferences can be extrapolated from the mobile video stats showed in supporting material.

ÿ

Large national festivals - arts &amp; music - and national conferences (start-up/ICT/health-care) will be targeted by Videobot to focus on maximizing the number of interactions - views, user generated videos, shares, subscriptions, archive content ingestion - centered on videos. The analytics of these interactions will allow Videobot to price its platform and related video apps for festivals and conferences using two pricing plans. Videobot hosts video and apps for its customers based on a cloud-based SaaS model. Both platform and app frameworks are priced to customers based on monthly/quarterly license fee in addition to integration services fees related to design and third-party back-end integration.

Manual edition costs become therfore inexistent. Furthermore, after the video edition has been automaticallyÿ accomplished, the conferencesÿ areÿ directly uploaded to a server where the collaborative serviceÿÿ is offered.

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ The Service ?basically? consists on a web platform that motivates collaborative transcriptions and translations of the videos by means of involving stakeholders of cultural entities.

2) an undeniable time saver method in the process of both indexing material (Entities) and finding interesting material (Users)

3) an elegant method for corporations to demonstrate to the public their concern for cultural issues (canalisation of CSR).

ÿ

Our team has a background in freelance work and (as most of the freelancers out there) - we lost a fair amount of money with unbillable out-of-scope work. We think we can turn this process around in a fun way.

ÿ

In our current company BuboBox (www.bubobox.com) we also experience this on a day-to-day basis, while working with large clients.

Research from the Belgian organization Unizo shows that almost fifty percent of all entrepreneurs use social media (august 2014). Large players such as Twitter, Google and Youtube currently play a big role in online communication. However, these communication channels evolve, and other players might come into view in the next years. It is foreseeable that forms of online communication will keep on evolving in the near future.

ÿ

In addition to social media, web publishing remains very important to a successful communication strategy. This means that a business owner needs to know about his or her website, e-mail, social media? Managing all these communication streams is undoable. Often one needs to contact different technical partners for online media, hosting, e-mail services? These tasks lay on the business shoulders without having the necessary time or knowledge to do them.

ÿ

Buzwebconnect is determined to resolve this problem by investing in the development of software tools. Tools that support creative communication over social networks and the web. A software tool should allow a business owner to manage information streams from one central platform. Web content management, social media channels, email campaigns and online reputation management can be managed from one place.

Serious games (SG) are computer games with another purpose beyond entertainment e.g. marketing or learning. Augmented Reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented e.g. by computer-generated elements like sound, video or graphics.

We want to develop and test 2 augmented reality (AR) entertaining games, based of FIWARE, using the same technology base (a common core to both games).

One games is a classic battle of spells AR-style, the player is a Wizard and his mobile device (phone or tablet) is a magic wand with spells to use against other wizards. The goal of the game is to collect new spells and defeat opponents to achieve a Master Wizard status. There are attack and protective spells, while AR Wizards, spells and creatures are rendered in the mobile device display. The learning edge is based on the recognition of real world objects with the device camera and including them in the game e.g. real world ingredients for a potion, or components to make a robotic AR creature. As an example a nitro-glycerine or dynamite potion making would require finding and recognizing in the real world ingredients (resembling) the real ones, providing a learning experience to the player in chemistry (and other areas: biology, agriculture, engineering etc.). Creatures will be animated via artificial intelligence techniques. This will be a light SG meaning that it is meant as an introduction to real-life systems and mechanisms, therefore the main purpose is entertainment with some light high level learning.

The other game, Exhibition Mission, is a networking game, its goal is to network, entertain (and support the goals of) any professional participating or attending any kind of exhibition, or conference with exhibition spaces. Each visitor will be invited to look for and perform missions available in the exhibition floor, like a treasure hunt. Some missions will be about meeting any or specific people (networking) or detecting products or displays of a specific brand (sponsored). Missions can be e.g. to solve brain puzzles or questions related with some exhibitors, having a virtual passport that is ?stamped? in some sponsor stands, and finding prizes and goodies with AR locator clues in the device. The most basic mission is to find and talk to another visitor that is also playing the game. Sponsored prize rewards are a possible incentive. Some missions will be sponsored, others defined by the organizers. The use of the game should be anonymous until any face to face conversation and optionally allow e.g. Linkedin connections.

The possibility to create mini TV clips of the battles or the missions, including the AR elements, to upload e.g. in video streaming sites like Youtube is also planned. These gaming clips are a recent trend and several gaming TV online streaming channels are popular. The use of these is meant to be as a dissemination tool for games viral marketing.

The company plans, as a business case, to create a common core platform to develop several AR serious games in the future. The target costumers for these games will be online and mobile players, with a revenue model based on online advertising (for entertaining games like Battle of Spells) and professional conference and exhibition organizers that wish to have a more engaging experience for their visitors, with a revenue model based on sponsorships and advertising (all games will promote each other hence exposing each player to all Yucca games).",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

This made me realise that consumers always play a passive part in the delivery process and are therefore reliant on other people to receive their goods. As virtual market places attract more and more customers, it is now time for a more efficient and customer-friendly delivery process. My experience in the logistics sector should be a great asset in the realisation of this goal.

ÿ

LogiTime is a Social Logistics Platform which focuses on last mile delivery ensuring a ZERO FAILURE process. Users no longer play a passive part in the delivery process, but are actively involved in it.

ÿ

Users influence the delivery process directly by customizing their time and place of delivery. Even though some suppliers have started specifying the delivery time of parcels, users still have no influence on the place of delivery. LogiTime enables the user to take charge of their deliveries, by specifying the time frame and the location for the goods to be delivered. This customized solution will ensure a hassle-free online shopping experience.

ÿ

Target / Consequence / How ÿ * Goods purchased on a virtual marketplace are delivered at the preferred time and to the preferred location. * Zero failure delivery process * Reduction of CO2 emissions * Empowerment of the consumer = active involvement in the process inspires confidence in secure and punctual delivery of goods * Enormous benefits for customers, KEP and online retailers alike * Consumers specify availabity and most suitable location for receiving goods = well-defined and structured process with gates ensures delivery first time every time.

ÿ

ÿ ÿ VALUE PROPOSITION OF LOGITIME:

Delivery of goods on theÿ preferred day at the preferred time considerably increases customer satisfaction when shopping online.

ÿ

GREEN LOGISTICS Environmentally-friendly solution which significantly reduces CO?-emission to less than 500 grams per parcel.

ÿ

The flexibility to choose a date (and time of day) for the delivery of their purchases keeps customers happy. Likewise, the consumersï ability to pick up their parcels a convenient location can also play a key role when it comes to customer satisfaction.

ÿ

The recent hype of medication and fresh food online sales demands logistics rethinking, given that it is now more important than ever to guarntee a zero failure delivery process.

ÿ

Significant reduction of the risk of cart abandonment leads to improved sales figures.

ÿ

Increased delivery quota and decreased administrative effort result in major cost reductions for retailers and Logistics Service Providers.

ÿ

Optimisation of the supply chain due to bundling of volumes creates synergies, which enable a more flexible, efficient and cost-effective process.

ÿ

Artificial intelligence in the digital retailing sphere

LogiTime makes predictions about their customersï preferences on the basis of precise customer data. Thanks to LogiTimeïs comprehensive gathering of user information, retailers are enabled to send out goods ? in some cases via automated solutions such as drones ? even before they are ordered.

Customer segments: 1. Manufacturers and retailers of interior design products (e.g. furniture, wallpapers, flooring materials etc.)ÿ 2. Individual consumers (or the app users) wishing to design a new or remodel an existing interior environment.

Basic functionalities: a) Add virtual objects and materials to existing or newly-designed spaces (the latter presented as graphics-based models) by selecting them from a database of various manufacturers/retailers. b) An efficient search tool with filtering options (see mockup). c) Computing the total cost for the user?s selections. d) Future inclusion of a social platform is considered to allow interaction across users (e.g., feedback and ratings on selections from friends and others).

The Core value for the consumers: Promotion of a confident decision-making by allowing the preview of products (from multiple retailers) in one?s environment ahead of purchase, the computation of costs and evaluation of alternatives, and the consideration of other users? feedback and suggestions on products. The use of the app is expected to reduce uncertainty in the purchase of household products and to allow users to create and evaluate comprehensive solutions for their spaces without sacrificing much time in visiting multiple stores for browsing.

The Core value for the retailers will be (1) the presence of a new avenue for showcasing products to a large market (2) the reduction in product returns as a consequence of the more informed decision making by consumers.

The innovation of the idea is multifaceted. First, the technical innovation is the use of the FI-WARE platform and the relevant GEs and SEs. Second, the scientific innovation is the use of novel computer vision algorithms developed by the Graphics and Hypermedia Lab for real-time rendering and foreground-background segregation. This will allow overcoming difficulties in existing apps (i.e. differentiating automatically a wall from an object that stands in front of it). Third, the business innovation is the marketing of an app that will involve products from multiple retailers. ÿThis will be in stark contrast to the attempts of various retailers to build their own proprietary apps for their products. The proposed app is placing down the foundation for a network effect (i.e., the initial inclusion of popular retailers will attract more app users which will in turn attract more retailers).

ÿ

The competitive advantage: To our knowledge, no other existing application uses augmented reality to allow the public to preview products from multiple retailers. Although certain retailers have developed their own apps, these exhibit severe limitations, mainly with foreground-background segregation. Here, we propose an app that will incorporate novel computer vision algorithms developed in-house to provide a better solution to this problem. In addition our team has years of experience in immersive Virtual Reality (VR) that is currently experimenting with affordable gear (e.g., the Oculus Rift, the Durovis Dive) that could be used with mobile devices. ÿGiven the large investments in VR hardware (e.g., Facebook Inc?s ÿ$2bn ÿacquisition of start-up Oculus VR, the recent collaboration of Oculus VR with Samsung to produce an HMD for the Note 4 smart phone etc.) we expect that mobile VR will become ubiquitous very soon. ÿThus, we aim to build in to our app the compatibility with mobile VR gear and provide first an augmented-reality immersive experience to consumers.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

It also enables them to sales directly their games on their own website.

ÿ

The links it refers are the direct link to anonymous testers and to contributing players (for getting analytic data from their experience in oder to improve the game accordingly) as well as the direct link for compensation (payment solution) since developers will be their own distributor.ÿThis solution shall bring a major change on the way a game is completed in its final phase, optimised (for improved playability) and sold to gamers. It aims at improving game quality (less bugs) and fun and at optimizing sales. All these taken together shall greatly boost developer financial sustainability.ÿ

ÿ

With Links2Gamer, developers are fully secured for sharing their Work-In-Progress release and to speed up the release date of their game, with bug-free and enriched releases. Links2Gamers delivers to small independant developers a more-than-equivalent solution that only a very few major game publishers have developed internally. Actually, it brings extra fonctionalities brought by our total embedded security. Security means that they have much more manoeuvre to create their game traction, have the game tested by their community.ÿFor an independant game developer, visibility of its game is the master word. Links2Gamer is the best tool to enhance it. Links2Gamer enables to feed the community around the game (from crowd-funders, free testers, early access volonteers, ...) with Work-In-Progress releases without limitation ( (no need to make a brided version) since our security is total. As a matter of fact, Links2Gamers is based on CLOUDSHIFT disruptive technology which deliver security by its key principle of extracting a portion of the game for executing it in a remote server, leaving no access to the potential pirates.ÿWithÿLinks2Gamer, total security is providing more freedom to developers, not less to gamers. It also reduces time to market for less bugged and more funny games.

ÿ

Links2Gamer also automatically forges all new and various releases that developers wish to offer its audience which paves the commercial life of the title: early-access, outright sale, rental, Trial and Buy, Ads-on freemium ...Here again, itÿexceeds what indie marketplaces offer with their outright buy version only. Additionally, becoming their own distributors, indie developers gain a lot in profit, pro-activity (price fixing policy) and get rid of heavy distributor retainer. This extra profitabiliiÿ

ÿ

In short, Indie developers concerntrate on what they are good at: making narrative and creative-rich new game experience and get more from it. Here are the main benefits for the developers are:

Get rid of piracy concern for sharing freely work-in-progress, create game visibility and get it tested freely.ÿ
	??Get freedom to define the commercialisation policy through various instantly set monetization schemes.
	Make a very big step in profitabiltiy (no more game test costs, no more heavy distribution retainer).
	Get control on user database for a more targeted marketing.
ÿ

The business model is a royalty to be set at 10 % on sales (versus 15 to 40% for VALVE and others).ÿ

ÿ

The marketing is based on:

Create our audience with empathic and content-rich blog with targeted email subscribers.
	Meet indie developers on various fairs and have a conference there (GDC)ÿ
	Communicate on ""Gamasutra"" and other specialized media
	Google Ads

Our proposal aims to improve the collaboration between citizens and the local municipalities.

Citizens are often not actively involved by the initiatives proposed by the institutions and, although that could be of interest for them, there are still several barriers in communication with authorities.

We have identified some of these barriers amplified in this time of economic crisis involving Italyand Europe and we focused on them the object of our proposal.

The problems that we would like to solve are the following:

give citizens the opportunity to speak out their own ideas concerning their town and ask for a collective participation to finance them
	give institutions the possibility to provide funds to support citizens in need
	provide a tool to book shared municipal services (pools, parks, theaters, events) and be able to pay without having to waste time in useless queues
	identify and tag assets, points of interest, access to services using NFC/RFID technology to allow citizens to report failures, to be authorized to use a service, to access to an area / building
We believe that applications useful to solve the above matters should be developed for the Internet and mobile architectures through the Web Oriented Architecture paradigm.

This means that it is necessary to develop applications integrating services that expose data and functionalities without having to rewrite them.

In the same way other applications can access data and services that will be made available as modules developed in this project.

The above activities will be provided through the development of the following innovative services:

Crowd-in-Social
	VirtuaPocket
	TaggedPOI
The services provided by these brand new modules can be considered and used independently butÿ in this project they will be integrated in a real mobile APP to increase its functionalities.

The APP is Linko MyCity developed by IKS.ÿ

ÿ

Crowd-in-Social service module:

Giving citizens and local institutions the opportunity to share ideas, initiatives, projects and social aid. The added value is to be able to actively involve citizens, the regional associations, the artisans to participate in their funding.ÿ

ÿ

VirtuaPocket service module: 

This module manages ? tokens? - the virtualÿ equivalent of an amount of money that the citizen entrusts to the municipality to access various services.

ÿ

TaggedPOI service module:

This module allows the institution to tag the territorial points of interest (POI). These points could be streets, monuments, public assets or the accesses to the services.ÿ Modern technology permits to have cheap and secure tags ÿ(RFID write at once, QRcode) and they can be read simply by smartphone.

Every 5 seconds someone somewhere in this world goes Blind.

ÿ

Every minute a Child goes Blind.

ÿ

Worldwide, there are 39.8 million blind people and 285.3 million people are estimated to be visually impaired (WHO, 2013). 153 million people are visually impaired only because they lack a visual aid. In Europe there are estimated to be over 30 million people, whose visual impairment is severe enough to cause significant impact on the course of their daily living. ÿPopular belief has always contended that blindness leads directly to deficiency and incapacity. Research shows that in the case of children, this is likely to impede many areas of development that can ultimately result in unemployment, social isolation, lack of participation in the community, psychological maladjustment.

ÿ

The high-tech era and modern electronic devices, e.g., laptops, tablets, e- has left behind blind and visually impaired. This is due to the fact that visual display units are the heart of all modern communication and information systems including the Internet. This especially affects those impaired individuals in the technical fields. The IT sector appears to lack a comprehension of the unique strengths and challenges facing blind people.ÿ

In general the Braille notetakers currently developed represent a classic type of assistive technology product: with only one line Braille text, no enough power for audio editing, scanning and recognizing print documents.

Braille notetakers are closed platforms, so what you see, is what you get. There is little if any possibility for software expansion and capabilities of the device. They are bulky and heavy; cannot be adapted for different applications and cannot ?display? technical, accounting, spreadsheets, or other specialized forms of display which are not a basic textual document. In addition it is very difficult for the blind person to make a buy decision because Braille notetakers? price ranges from ?4,000 to nearly ?13ÿ000 (Friedom Scientific Ltd., HIMS Ltd., HumanWare Ltd., Baum Retec AG). Overall they are poorly supported, expensive and often developed and designed in isolation from users, leading to inefficient use.ÿ

ÿ

BLITAB Technology GmbH developed a unique solution (in IP procedure) to address these issues based on an integration of innovative technology, ecological psychology and social design.

ÿ

Let me introduce you the future of involving blind and visually impaired people in the modern social community we are living today! BLITAB is the World?s first tablet for Blind people.

ÿ

BLITAB is a next curve Braille device for reading and writing that displays one whole page Braille text, without mechanical elements. It provides an innovative design concept of a Braille multimedia device based on open discussions with blind people and absolutely new technology based on liquid smart materials which instead of using a screen form small physical bubbles. They rise and fall on demand, composing a whole page in Braille code. The developed technology has not been used till now in this market niche.

Switzerland",Consumer health/wellness,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Nenad Stojanovic,"Regular performing physical activities, like running or cycling, is a prerequisite for a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Nowadays there are plenty of apps for tracking users during physical activities and providing different statistics about performed activities (distance, calories burned, ?). There is an extremely positive trend: installations of sports and fitness apps will grow to 248 million in 2017, up from 156 million in 2012

However, two main challenges for ensuring healthy lifestyle are related to how to keep people to stay active and to improve their performances (or at least not to degrade). Only by ensuring that these problems are resolved properly, the benefits of being active will be sustainable. Based on our comprehensive overview of related systems we have found only a few mobile systems which are oriented toward motivating people during the run, focused on collecting reward points for performed activities in the form of very simple gamification (e.g. Zombies, Run!). Therefore, there is a gap between the need for a more intensive motivation (i.e. engagement) during exercising and current apps offering. We plan to close that gap by exploiting the creative potential of engagement process. Indeed, there are many evidences from the research experiments that the real effects in keeping trying to be better in exercising are achieved with working on willpower and positive attitude, that will boost the flow of positive energy which is required for overcoming inner temptation.

We propose a new approach for engaging people through a mobile service that combines excitement for being physically active with the positive energy for being creative. The main component is the mobile app that monitors performing a physical activity (based on a training plan, or free-style exercising) and engages the user in a proper way in the case that she/he is deviating from the plan, or expressing other evidences that the willpower is going down. The main advantage is related to the possibility to detect automatically a deviation in exercising (by exploiting a novel technology for real-time processing on mobile) and getting creative, more-engaging recommendations, based on user?s preferences and updated regularly, that will ensure the long-term effect of the changes in the lifestyle, leading to behavioral changes, which is the ultimate goal in this type of solutions. The system will be able to learn from the usage feedback, ensuring the continual improvement of the system.

Such an engagement will be provided through a mobile solution consisting of a) mobile app which represents an activty monitor and serves as a sensor for collecting real-time data and a detector of situations when the user can be engaged, b) server where all user data is stored and processed through analytics module in order to update users profiles and personalize services for engaging the user (past data to define the dynamic user engagement plan) and c) web portal for enabling users to provide their preferences and trainers/business ÿto configure and publish their plans.

MyCultreTrip?s goal is to enrich the representation of cultural entities (from a monument to a historic path, to festivals and other events), understand the impact of city culture on people, and create compelling and engaging experiences for both travelers and citizens.

It brings together a set of technologies that leverage open and crowdsourced data, curated content by expert users, as well as social media content and achieves its goal by building upon three basic blocks:

ÿ


	Cultural content mining and extraction, for collecting culture-related content from various sources such as open data, crowdsourced data and social networks and other web sources and linking it to content and data from official cultural sources.
	
	
	Visit modelling and personalisation, for understanding the patterns and preferences of tourists and individuals and devise appropriate recommendation mechanisms to assist the planning and execution of cultural visits.
	
	
	User engagement and interaction, for motivating people to explore cultural resources and share their experiences and content with the online community.
	
ÿ

The local or regional scope of MyCultreTrip helps the visitor, or even a resident, to discover different aspects of the city. Depending on the trip phase (planning, actual visit, post-visit), MyCultreTrip assists the city culture exploration in different ways:

ÿ


	Planning: Offers a rich web-based interface and tools for browsing landmarks and events of a particular place. Moving beyond existing POI browsing interfaces, MyCultreTrip supports exploration and search, itinerary presentation (i.e. popular/thematic routes through the city), and scheduling/planning facilities. The latter can be used in combination with the MyCultreTrip mobile app, a necessary tool during the visit. MyCultreTrip platform will provide personalised recommendations based on the user's interests and preferences. The user's cultural tourism preferences will be extracted by our framework from the user's multimedia trip records and they will be used in order to propose relevant cultural artefacts and events and to aggregate them into itineraries. Abstract matching is supported, exploiting the user?s social profile. Multimedia presentation of the city will allow visitors to quickly go through landmarks, popular sights etc and get additional information on each. The outcome of the planning process will be a full itinerary taking into consideration also the travelling time, the opening hours, the walking, the recommended time to spend in every venue.
	
	
	Actual Visit: The application helps visitors keep track of what they are interested in visiting and provides contextual information for each POI. Storytelling (e.g. route narratives) and gamification (e.g. point gathering) features, encourage the visitor to put more attention to the visited cultural entities and to explore further aspects of the city. Recommendations provided, will be dynamically adapted around the planned visit and the user?s location, habits and history.
	
	
	Post-visit: We all want to preserve our precious moments. We cherish them and we want to revisit them and share them with our friends. MyCultreTrip offers personal archiving and ?retracing? mechanisms. In that way, visitors are provided with tools to ?replay? their cultural experiences (through a web-based or/and mobile interface). Particular emphasis is put on the motivation of visitors through gamification mechanisms to provide feedback and content, documenting their experiences. In that way, it will be possible to enrich even further the representation of cultural entities accessible through the platform of MyCultreTrip.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Fratte 49, 38057 Pergine Valsugana (TN), Italy",Horizontal (solutions suitable for every verticals),0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Silvano Samaretz,"Our idea begins from a product of ours that we developed some years ago. This product is an Outlook alike calendar (www.webappointment.it). This represents an old concept of reservation management and is thought only for companies that need to manage a lot of appointments. This system does not take into account user needs: users have to call company booking offices during opening hours, they need to go to the office to hand documents and the workflow is not optimize that means time loss. We think that systems like this are exceeded.

Our submission will improve the classical reservation process. We want to create a new advanced system to manage reservations/appointments, for all those companies that offer services through booking/request process. We will develop a big central framework that manages all companies and allows them to process all client requests (reservation, documents, customer assistance). On the other side, the final user will use a dedicated mobile app. Through it he can make reservations 24/24 hours every day of the week, scan and upload documents and ask for assistance/informations using the chat.

ÿ

The actual reservation process:

Users, who need an appointment, call the company booking office and the operator that receives the phone-call asks for user's profile and needs and usually reserves the appointment for the first avaliable time-slot with the desired characteristics. Then the user have to go to the office to hand all requested documents.

ÿ

Our innovative idea:

The system we submit is composed by a mobile app and an administration panel (used by companies for manage user requests). The app will optimize the process described above. In order to use this app, the user has to enroll into the system: it essentially asks some personal informations like name, surname, address, birth date, etc. These data will be memorized in our cloud through a safe procedure. After the registration step, the user is allowed to make reservations autonomously. He will search a suitable date and hour in the desired office and he will send a request for a particular service. The system will process it. If the request is eligible, the time-slot will be reserved and the app will guide the user through some other functionalities related to the requested service. If the request is rejected, the user will be notified: he now can choose to send another request or eventually contact an operator for assistance. The strength of our projects that user can use the mobile app for all those companies that will purchase our software. Our goal is to expand as more as possible the set of companies that use it, in order to offer a full service to the final users. One app for many services.

All communications between user and company will be managed through internal messages, chat and emails.

The app will integrate a live chat for operator assistance. There will also be an online guide, to lead the user throught the correct procedure for reserving the appointment.

An interesting document scanner will be integrated to upload documents and photos: for particular service (for example examinations or financial assistance) it will be useful submit additional documentation to optimize time during the appointment. User can also synchronize his calendar with external account (Google, iCloud, ...) to correctly manage future appointments and consult the history of his past appointments.

The potential of our project is that the app may be used with all companies that have our web system and entire booking process will be really fast.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

The key idea is to make shop windows dynamically adapt, and customizing the offer by matching the individual users' taste.

ÿ

In fact, traditional shop windows display only a limited number of items, selected a priori and regarded as the most attractive for the average customer. This requires time and effort by window-dressers to effectively render the prominent collection of the shop at a single glance. At the same time, only a subset of the whole collection is presented, with a limited number of colours and appositions, which may not be exhaustive to capture and satisfyÿ the interest of the entire potential customers portfolio.

ÿ

By exploiting an innovative technology able to track in real-time the gaze of a customer looking at a shop window, our system will gather users? preferences and enhance the experience of the window-shopper according to what attracts his/her attention. This will be achieved in different ways, including the chance of presenting a set of related products on a background video-wall, or in other colour nuances, combinations, reporting fashion shows or famous people dressing similar clothes, and also including personalized discounts and offers. More complex settings may also provide animations, in order to capture the user?s silhouette and showing him/her dressed with that particular item.

ÿ

The core of the system consists of two main components: (i) an affordable customized imaging system (the ?Shop?s Eye?, SE) able to track the gaze of the client and to map it into the retail window; (ii) a smart engine based on a set of customizable rules (the ?Window Salesperson?, WS), which pilots the output devices based on the identified customer?s interests. The SE will be a low-cost architecture made of a RGB+D camera connected with a processing unit able to track in real-time the gaze of multiple persons in front of the shop window. The WS will be a rule-based engine, driven by the visual keywords received by the SE, and providing different sets of outputs according to the available actuators (e.g., retrieving and showing images and video stored in a server, activating automation functions, managing a simple interaction with the user).

ÿ

It is worth mentioning that the system would not bring in any privacy ? related issue, as no sensitive information is retained. Instead, uLook will collect many precious information regarding the most attractive items, anonymized users? preferences, relatedness between items displayed and sold, correlations between disposition and attractiveness, etc.

ÿ

uLook will fulfil different needs, from big stores that need to make their offer more attractive, to shops or chains that want to extend their customers portfolio by complementing each other in the offer, to online stores willing to invest in shop windows to better advertise their products. On the users' side, it will provide customers with a completely new window-shopping experience, by seamlessly merging traditional shopping with ?web browsing-like? capabilities.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Important functionality includes crowdfunding, selection and rating of ideas, books or processes and community building exploiting widely accepted social platforms.

WePublish follows a novel approach, based on the latest developments in the publishing industry:

the digital transition in the sector is transforming all links in the value chain, from authoring, editing, production and printing till marketing and distribution. Smaller publishing houses have to cope with these changes.
	while very large publishing houses are dominating the global market, smaller houses in national markets are organising themselves vertically, often with considerable success.
	social media and stakeholder participation as well as crowdfunding approaches for project financing are getting increasingly important for today?s economy.
ÿ

After the tremendous success of the first crowdfunding platforms, including the US market leader Kickstarter, the first vertical solutions have appeared. In the publishing sector, there are three vertical crowdfunding platforms, UNBOUND.COM (UK), PUBLUSH.COM (US), AUTHR.COM (US).

ÿ

Compared to the business approach of the existing crowdfunding , WePublish comes with the following two innovations:

it will be offered as ?glocalised? solution, following the cultural concets of a region or a domain.
	it will connect publishers, authors and readers, using a novel approach.
In fact, current crowdfunding models are sharing a common main process: (1) author has book concept -&gt; (2) author describes book concept -&gt; (3) readers fund book concept.

ÿ

WePublish will involve the publishers in the chain, allowing, in a flexible manner, several alternative processes:

ÿ

(1) publishers describe his open project(s) -&gt; (2) readers fund book concept -&gt; (3) publishers publishes selected projects,ÿorÿ
	(1) author has book concept -&gt; (2) publishers apply for the project -&gt; (3) readers fund book concept.
ÿ

Even more advanced scenarios might also be implemented, e.g. publisher driven (publisher seeks for author) or reader driven (reader suggests book concepts, publisher publishes reader commissioned books). Business model will depend on the finally selected scenarios, probably a small percentage of the raised capital.

ÿ

From the technical perspective, WePublish will stand on four pillars that represent the main functionality:

(a) crowdfunding marketplace

(b) social module: interfaces to social media, blogs, ratings

(c) analysis module: detects trends and compiles statistics

(d) matchmaking component: seeks for suitable publishers or authors.

ÿ

The project is in the experimentation phase. We have implemented a first tailored crowdfunding module for the publishing house Kondyli (www.kondyli.gr). In parallel, during the last months we have performed a first qualitative survey, including over 20 publishing houses (15 in Greece, 5 in Germany) and 6 authors (4 in Greece, 1 in Germany, 1 in UK). The idea has been more than well accepted and we have collected valuable feedback.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

The main purpose of Egoberg will be the improvement of one?s self-assessment, the motivation for self-perfection of the individual and the improvement of the relationships between the people in a given society. This will be achieved through a better transparency which will motivate the users to build their reputation and to have higher morality. How? In the first stage Egoberg will be based on a mobile app with limited functionality ? a minimum vialble product (MVP). The reason for the limited functionality of the app will be an easier usability for new users and the building of the user?s loyalty without making the use of the platform too difficult integrating too many features. After creating an own profile the two main features for the users of Egoberg will be writing comments and scoring 10 characteristics of other users.

Here we present the main points of the business idea ofÿTeach.Me.Now.ÿ

Please start from here or from the supportingÿvideo presentation ÿattached (file TEACHMENOW_IDEA+HL_MOCKUP.mp4), which explains the business idea in simple terms - for end users and prospective customers. The second part of the video also introduces 'How it works', which shows functionalities and screens and is also relevant to the 'Mockup'.

For the complete description of our business model - based on Business Model Canvas methodology - please see the attached Business Model Canvas document (TEACH_ME_KNOW Business Plan.pdf)

ÿ

Product overview

We will develop Teach.Me.Now, a solution for effective Remote Coaching over the Internet.

The product will have a focus on effective teaching of performing arts (such as music and dance), which require realistic audio-visual interaction and continuous feedback between coach and student. However it will not be limited to music and dance - teaching fitness and other disciplines related to well-being is also an important use case for the product.

ÿ

Why Teach.Me.Now! ?

If you are a music (or other art) student wishing to find the best teacher fitting your skills/ musical goals, or you want to find a teacher near you for an unconventional instrument (say bagpipes), or your life is busy and you cannot travel weekly to the music school to meet your teacher, then you likely need remote coaching. ÿAlso, you could save money if you ÿwould take part in group lessons....

And if you are an artist/ performer/ personal trainer, and make your living out of teaching/ coaching, you need a way to reach more students, make the more out of your time, and have an easier life

reach new students/ clients, even for occasional lessons;
improve your service and make more money (for example, offering a daily checkup lesson in addition to weekly face-to-face lessons)
make more money by selling and running group lessons, or creating and publishing video recordings of your lessons
improve your service, using modern teaching techniques based on multimedia (recording, reviewing together performance)
ÿ

Remote coaching for performative arts over the Internet is just at its beginnings.

Today most of this business goes through a generic technology such as Skype, and there is much room for improvement ?

So ? HERE IS TEACH.ME.NOW!!!

ÿ

What and howÿ

The driver for our project will be ?Remote Coaching beyond Skype?. Skype-based lessons are becoming popular - see http://www.takelessons.com. We will create a product which is much more compelling to coaches and student and is best aligned with the practice of how teaching happens in the real world.

We will develop an application which allows teachers and students to find one another, run lessons as in a real class, share content and assignments, and more.

The app (in the final product) will be available on different devices (tablet, desktop, smartphone, smart TV, ...), so as to be usable by everyone in her preferred setting. The prototype will focus on the Web version + app for one mobile platform.

WebRTC technology and its implementation in FI-WARE will be a fundamental component of the product we will implement.

The service will be available in Italian and English language first, and then possibly extended to other EU languages according to market opportunities.

We expect revenues for our product to come from two main sources

subscription fees paid by coaches
a transaction fee paid as a percentage of each lesson run on the platformÿ

Brief description of the solution

Our objective is to develop a solution for the remote attendance of live events over the internet.

The solution will focus on managing events like workshop or conference but also cultural and artistic events will be taken into account during the development.

This technology makes it possible to share in real-time content, ideas and experiences with attendees across multiple geographies and time zones.

Features will be provided to better engage and involve the remote audience in the overall event experience.

The solution will give the user the possibility to explore content related to the event (during but also after the end of it) at any time.

Problem to be solved

if you have been a participant in a conference ?

How many times have you not take part in a conference because too far away or to expensive?ÿ
	How many times have you had to give up to participate in a conference for other work commitments?
	How many times would you have wanted to talk with the speaker and there was not enough time?
	And moreover? how many times don't you remember the participants and what were discussed after the conference?
If you have been a speaker in a conference...

How many times have you found difficulties to maintain high the attention of your audience?
	How many times could you not answer all the questions you have been asked for lack of time?
	And how many times would you have wanted to continue a dialogue with the participants for your business?
Our solution is designed to resolve these issues through a dedicated application for speakers and participants of an event.

How do it?

There are few solutions on the market that accompany the speaker and the audience during and after the event.

Our solution will bridge this gap. How?

By allowing the remote participation through registration to a ""virtual room"" connected to the live event and by using an application for mobile devices, which allows you to hear or see the presentation of the speaker, follow the slide presentation and additional content (audio, video, documents, ...) shown during the speech.
	By providing a feature/function thanks to which users and speaker will be able to interact with each other submitting questions, comments, impressions. No longer a one-way communication but a bi-directional one.
	By allowing a speaker to submit live questions or survey to the public, in order to collect the results and show them on the big screen
	By sharing on large screen the more interesting questions or comments of the event
	By providing the participants, whether they are physically present or remote attendees, a library of content related to the event always available both during and after the event
	By providing a new business model to sell online recorded event speech
Our solution allows you to go beyond a normal videoconferencing application providing features of innovative presentation interactionÿ and a new business model to sell event participation.

Technologies like WebRT and webconferencing technologies with the implementations in FI-WARE and the FI-Lab Cloud environment will be key components of the solution.

We believe that FI-WARE and FI-LAB are fundamental enablers for the phases of the prototype of the solution being able to provide an environment infrastructure tested and versatile. The ability to instantiate virtual machines with tier already preconfigured and technical documentation of Generic Enabler provided, greatly reduces startup times on the technologies used.

Based on a combination of FI-WARE solutions and MotoriaLab services, ski area users at any levels will be able to track their performance, store personal data and get individualized profiles. The personalization of the outdoor sport experience will be also offered with physical sites (sport rooms), also managed by the ski-areas. The HI-FIS infrastructure will be modular and deployable also in minor skiing resort, e.g. covering a sector for ski school training, competitive athletes, new aggregation areas for winter sports. The project ÿtimely addresses a potential critical risk for Alpine economy, of a decreasing access to ski areas, a key resource for the tourism ecosystem. Ski areas need to redesign their offer, with a specific attention to the new generations. Here we are envisioning a structured set of solutions that offers more competitiveness, with new approaches that will better sell their product: the experience of one day spent on the ski slopes. ÿMoreover the market of smartphones and wearable sensors (WS) is growing fast. WS market has an estimated yearly CGAR of 30% in the next 3 years, market projections indicate that by 2018 137.27 million units of WS will be delivered. This project is remarkably valid in Trentino, where a major investment in the last years has led to the ÿconstruction of a 800 km optical fiber network. Such infrastructure is currently not exploited by the tourism industry, and in particular novel services are lacking for the national and international customers. The FI-WARE framework will give the opportunity to build new fast ICT infrastructures for data and web services, also in remote places, with a specific focus to ski slopes and snow parks which are the new centre of interest for young people within ski areas. ÿ

In the first phase of the project, MotoriaLab will develop HI-FIS hardware infrastructure and services as B2B product for ski-areas, delivering WIFI mesh network, video cameras set up, WS to be used plug and play and an entertainment booth at the end of the slope where to deliver the processed output (video, 3d mapping, georeferenced data coming form WS) to the user. The idea is to create a ?take home your performance? video and statistics like in a real entertainment fun park setup. A video of an experimental run performed last season on the Donei slope in Cermis is attached as documentation. A definite market interest on this product has already been indicated by two Ski Areas in Trentino: the San Martino di Castrozza - Tognola (for the snow park) and Cermis ski area (for the ski slope). A letter of interest for the product by the Tognola ski area manager can be found as attached external file. 

Secondly, HIFIS B2B services will be developed to provide measures and feedback as in a real outdoor laboratory: we aim to sell services for all those interested into having high resolution data about athletes performances (ski national teams, ski schools, ski clubs) and products or prototypes of the sport equipment industry. Remarkably, the University of Padova?s Sports Research group (Prof. Petrone - School of Engineering) has already commissioned a HI-FIS prototype system o be used for the world conference ISSS 2015 in San Vito di Cadore (March 8-13 2015; ÿinfo at http://www.isss2015.com/). Third, for the B2C market, motorialab will deliver web/mobile services connecting HI-FIS services to its Skilo web/app platform (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.fbk.mpba.skilo) to revolutionate and improve skiers skiing experience and entertainment. The final goal in this case is to enable for all HI-FIS users high resolution geospatial personal services as for example quantified self-tracking and self-evaluation, performance optimization. In terms of market expansion, we wish to offer HI-FIS?s users a complete new skiing experience starting from Trentino and then marketing the product and its services at alpine scale and then around the world. Remarkably, the same infrastructure and business model could be used also for summer outdoor activities, as example downhill biking, mountain biking and bike parks.

SoLoMoN is a toolkit that allows brands and retailers to easily, quickly and safely design and deploy mobile, context-aware, interactive and social applications aimed at enhancing the shoppers? experience and at more effectively engaging them. SoLoMoN takes advantage of the emerging wave of wearable devices that together with the increasing capabilities of smartphones can take shopping applications? user experience to the next level.

SoLoMoN connects to: (i) a variety of wearable devices, including but not limited to smart glasses, iWatch, activity-tracking bracelets (ii) a large number of indoor and outdoor localization technologies (including but not limited to: WiFi, BLE/iBeacons, GPS etc.) (iii) social networking platforms and social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, Vine). Data from all such channels is gathered and processed and context cues are used to enhance the user experience and target advertising and offers.

SoLoMoN is made available in the form of a cloud-based platform and a Software Development Toolkit (SDK) that allow developers to quickly prototype and deploy their app. The SDK allows to define complex event triggers (E.g., Google Glass within 10m from position (x,y,z) is in front of an ad of brand QW, and two of my friends like the QW page on Facebook), and to define corresponding actions (E.g., Send a notification on the user?s iWatch that she has a time-limited discount of 20% and that in case she uses it within the next 4 hours her Facebook friends will get a similar voucher). SoLoMoN allows application designers and marketing agencies to focus on the creative aspects of the design of engaging, interactive advertising, and hinders the complexity related to processing in real-time and in a scalable way streams of data coming from different channels and devices.

Target customers of SoLoMoN are marketing companies and brands? in-house advertising agencies, which can leverage the SoLoMoN platform and SDK to substantially reduce the time (and money) required to design, develop and deploy interactive shopping applications.

The business model underpinning SoLoMoN includes two main streams of revenues. The first revenue stream is a one-time setup fee, which is required to access the SDK for commercial purposes and provides also the ability to setup indoor environments in case they are part of the advertising campaign (including, e.g., providing maps of the environment and/or registration of beaconing devices etc.). The other revenue stream is a recurrent one, based on a monthly fee, for accessing, through the SDK, the services provided by the SoLoMoN platform where all data processing will take place. Three tiers are foreseen for the service fee, depending on the number of users foreseen for the app.

SoLoMoN will include a number of generic FI-WARE enablers, mostly focused on the processing of contextual data and the triggering of application-level actions. Further, various specific FI-CONTENT2 enablers will be integrated to provide means for supporting interaction patterns. FI-WARE enablers will be at the core of the SoLoMoN SDK. Their use will enable the applicant to speed up significantly the design, development and integration processes while achieving significant cost savings. The SoLoMoN platform will be hosted on FI-LAB and will have open APIs. The applicant is committed to contribute to the FI-WARE Community by releasing as open source any enhancement of the FI-WARE GEs/FI-CONTENT2 SEs that will be developed within the scope of the project.ÿÿ",Tech provider,,X,X,X,0,X,,Software,Marketing,Applications,Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Applications,1,X,www.u-hopper.com,SME,50000,u-hopper.com

They are currently used widely in the ICT field (train stations speech announcements, robots, avatars, call center, audiobooks, GPS navigation systems).ÿ However, the use of TTS in creative or artistic context is still limited nowadays.

ÿ

The goal of Personalizable TTS is to add the personalization dimension to TTS technology and to make it easy to use. In this way, a creative and personal use of TTS technology will be possible.

ÿ

Personalizable TTS is a web application service capable of creating the personal voice model of any human speaker, taking as input the audio recording of a few utterances.

ÿ

The user just needs to connect to the MIVOQ service (using any internet connected device with a microphone, e.g.: smart-phone, desktop PC) and read aloud a few dozens of sentences. Personalizable TTS algorithms will create a digital model of the author's voice.

ÿ



ÿ

ÿ

ÿ

ÿ

ÿ

ÿ

ÿ

The voice model will possess the vocal characteristics (timbre, prosody) of the target speaker.ÿ Moreover, if the speaker uses special speech styles when recording (shouting, whisper, happy-voice, sad-voice, ...), also the resulting models will possess such expressive features.

ÿ

This functionality will be employed by users who want to experiment with new and creative applications of speech synthesis.

Once created, the voice models will be loaded by the TTS web services in order to generate personalised synthetic speech.ÿ The ability of creating voices with creative speech styles, the ease of use and the possibility of automating the voice building procedure opens the doors to the entertainment markets, making feasible the characterization ofÿ synthetic voices for video games, online role playing games, special effects, animation movies.

ÿ



ÿ

The value proposition of MIVOQ consists on offering much more flexible synthetic voices in terms of prosody and lower prices for its personalization or the creation of new voices.
This is due to the innovative technologies adopted and optimized by MIVOQ. These technologies, called Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis (SPSS) and Speaker Adaptation, are known in the research field of speech synthesis but unprecedented in the business world.

ÿ

Such a personal, creative use of this technology is original and innovative and it will breed a new generation of applications.
Personalizable TTS can be applied to social media, web 2.0, domotics, video games, ebook, e-learning, movie industries.

A few examples:

Automatically create an audio podcast from the contents of a blog;
	Create a version of the voice messages from the Facebook wall, with ÿ the authors' voices;
	Automatic services that give different voices to animation movies characters;
	Customization of video games (MMORPG games, cloud games, ...) characters voices;
	Services that read SMS and emails with the author's voice;
	Telephone answering services, in addition to customization of auto-reply text messages, also require the feature of voice personalization;
MIVOQ Personalizable TTS is able to meet all this needs.

ÿ

Furthermore, thanks to the ability of creating a TTS voice from few speech recordings, Personalizable TTS should be used in the social area (aid for speech impairment - voice preservation).

The interface is based on a visual language paradigm where the user assembles the various visual elements (text, buttons, images, lists and grids) and build the application logic using a drag and drop paradigm.

It is possible to simulate/preview the app before testing and finally deploying it on the actual devices.

Even though no programming experience is required, the tool can be profitably used by professional developers and software houses as well, to accelerate development for applications that are suited for our framework or for rapid prototyping.

ÿ

The objective of this proposal is to expand Foneclay scope to support Internet of Things (IoT) application.

We believe that the initial deployment of the IoT will be quite fragmented in terms of standards, systems and types of objects. In this environment, our goal is to accelerate IoT adoption by providing a development framework that simplifies app design/development and deployment.

ÿ

So far, the Foneclay platform has been used by artists and brand to implement creative and amazing user interfaces. We would like to provide a similar tool in the frame of IoT, to allow everybody to develop creative and innovative apps using a simple and intuitive designer tool. In this way, we are reducing the knowledge barrier needed to create innovative IoT applications, thus increasing the number of potential users and innovators.

ÿ

FI-WARE platforms feature early and rich implementation of new IoT technologies and standards. This represents a unique worldwide opportunity to implement and fine tune support for next generation IoT applications.

For example, the FIWARE IoT Service Enablement GEs could be used to connect Context Entities in a Smart Home scenario, including a remotely controllable coffee maker, smart TV, climate controller, etc. Then, the Foneclay framework will manage the app queries, say, for the coffee machine in the IoT network and provide the user with our visual language for creating powerful constructs, based on which our software building features will create the native code running on actual devices and giving the desired performances.

ÿ

Eventually, this activity could also pave the way for another FIWARE enabler, and we would be happy to provide Foneclay services to the FIWARE community through FI-Lab for developing innovative apps within the FI-WARE.

Wireless sensors that act as nodes detection without power supplies, could be very interesting considering applications in the field of the Internet of Things and in smart home and building.

In several applications a growing demand for more accurate measurements about goods and their valuable dynamic parameters is paving the way to more accurate traceability devices able to make also some basic computational evaluation directly within the goods.

For example, the so-called ""luxury food"" cold-chain monitoring, paintings and sculptures preservation conditions, historical and art environment surveillance are ideal candidates to be equipped with high performance electronic devices able to monitoring and data logging parameter's measurements and to evaluate dynamic information to assure accessibility, safety and privacy compliance.

Billions of e-things that need to be recharged while are moving faster or entering different locations or are attached to, if not even encapsulated within the goods they are monitoring, show a nightmare scenario in which the so-called Internet of Things could become the Internet of Things with Dead Batteries, with billions of devices never responding and never uploading vital data.

In this scenario, we propose the Artenna project.

Artenna is an electronic ""smart"" panel made of an antenna embedded in a medium or printed over the surface that can be used as an artwork and, at the same time, paves the way to the Internet of Things. Artenna is realized by a deposition of metallic paint on a panel of low cost material, such as acrylic or PVC.

The electronic inside the Artenna is able to query a series of microcircuits equipped with sensors placed on the panel with different features and able to be powered by the RF signal collected by the main antenna.

The design of the panel is at the same time, electronic and art. The antenna can be or not in view in order to adapt to a modern or classical design.

The sensors, removable from the panel, can be arranged also close to the panel to distances of the order of a few meters.

Artenna can integrate several sensors as:

- Temperature, humidity

- UV, IRÿ

- Smoke detector

- Air quality detector

- Proximity

The antenna formed on the panel is able to:

- Obtain energy from RF signals (RF energy harvesting), particularly in the UHF band in which there are numerous sources commonly available

- Interrogate smart RFID tags on the panel or in the vicinity acquiring parameters and measurement data

- Send data via Wi-Fi or BLE to Internet

- Through the use of technology FI-WARE it is possible categorize, analyze and make available information and events generated by the system.

ÿ

Artenna system implements IoT Orion Context Broker for devices observations, send commands, and publish context information. Artenna publish context information on the Context Broker that can be retrieved by smartphones or a web interface that can subscribe to notification of updated context.

Artenna can integrate a number of ambient sensors with context-awareness and can connect to other RFID sensors tags in the proximity, acting as a gateway. The user can personalize e.g. the location of the Artenna, allowing providing context-awareness of the sensors data.

For example Artenna, as context producer, registers its sensors within a room, and update context information by updating sensors values to the Context Broker server. The user can be notified on smartphone/web-site when there is a change on context information (e.g. a temperature variation in a specific room). The user will have a dashboard to monitor sensors data.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

102,CREA102,CREA,CREAtiFi,Italy,Social IT srl - software and consulting,LE(stre)SS : an application for the stress management and the quality of social life,"Via Kufstein 5, 38121 Trento (TN), Italy",Consumer health/wellness,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Social IT srl and InMente cooperativa sociale as partners,"Our idea consists in an application/website, called LE(stre)SS, for the assessment of stress level and proposal of practical and effective solutions through an innovative ?social? concept.

The stress condition has a significant presence and impact on modern western society, and it has spread more and more due to the recent economic changes in Europe, which have caused an increase in the job insecurity perception. Stress has negative consequences on quality of life, on productivity at work and ultimately on health conditions, also resulting in extra expenses for companies and for healthcare associations.

Our idea is to propose a technological solution to this problem, helping to recognize the stress condition, performing an assessment and proposing practical solutions. This is realized through a friendly and usable application for the stress assessment, created thanks to the psychological ÿexpertise of our partner, InMente. In particular, the assessment will be performed in the dimension of gamification, transforming the tests into both a game and a ?social network?.

Actually, our idea is not a conventional social network, but a ?social accelerator?, which is a truly innovative concept, called YOut. YOut aims at finding the solution ?outside the cycle? of stress, which consists in a problem repeating itself indefinitely in the person's mind. Our application creates the conditions for the introduction of an external element interrupting the vicious cycle, pushing the user to ?go out?, physically and metaphorically, and find a solution of the problem outside of his/her own mind.

Our idea of ?social? is then quite different from that associated with the totality of the existing social networks. In fact, the objective is not to increase the number of contacts, or to connect people who live physically far from each other: the goal is instead cultivating our few ?close? relationships (in both geographic and mental terms), by facilitating ?real?, face?to-face meetings, which can be difficult to organize, while living a busy and stressful life.ÿOr, also, it could be a mean to get to know people better, in order to start to build close relationships. The application actually facilitates the ?match? between the needs of people who are alone, and would simply like to have an instant, overall view on those of their friends who are available, here and now, to ?really? meet them.ÿ

Other means of ?social? solutions would be invitations to events, conferences, courses, activities available in the user?s area of residence, and based on the user?s profile. In addition, a list of professionals and services dedicated to psychological help is proposed, available in user?s area of residence.ÿ

ÿ

As far as we know, no such application currently exists, since the conventional social networks focus on ""virtual"" life and communication, and the existing stress assessment applications consist in a mere palliative approach to the symptoms with no proposal of possible solutions.

ÿ

Our customers would be individual users, companies, companies organizing events and activities interested into the anonym localized data collected, healthcare associations and associations offering psychological help. At the same time, these customers could be our distributors and/or sponsors.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

It has a network of direct sales made ??by employees and business partners disseminated to the Italian country. One of our most mature software lines, which has had much success, is aimed at the market of social and computerises social cooperatives, associations, foundations, etc.

For the characteristics of the products that we develop and the high costs associated with traditional commercial activities, we cannot reach the market segment represented by smaller organizations (small in terms of incomes but still involving a considerable number of staff, such as for example volunteers).

To attack this market we decided to change the business model. We want to create a software for small non-profit organizations delivered as a SAAS (software as a service) and completely free. The revenues for the maintenance and development of the system will come from some main sponsors that will promote their products and services to all users of the platform, we will create a dedicated website to the sponsors, eventually with an associated marketplace.

The field that we have identified is that of volunteer management, with a system that manages recruitment, selection, communications, activities? planning, attendance check and training.

The field of volunteering is particularly suited to the business model that we intend to apply because the target is sufficiently large and homogeneous to be able to, on the one hand , arouse interest in certain categories of sponsors (eg . Banks, insurance companies, telephone companies, etc. ) and, second, to be used for pay per click campaigns. We also believe that the conditions exist to create a ""viral"" effect that allows a rapid propagation of the application.

To these considerations we can also add the fact that organizations that engage volunteers are generally poorly computerized despite of the large number of personal data that they manage and despite of their need of an advanced management of communications (newsletters, sms, facebook, phone calls, etc.).

The platform will allow the volunteers to sign up and set their time availability, and view requests from voluntary organizations (there will be a multi-parameter search engine).

Organizations, after signing in, will publish requests for volonteers and search for other organizations in the database.

The system, after the first phase of association between volunteer and organization, will be used as management software, this means that it will be possible within the organizations? reserved area to use all functions including:

activities planning,
	files sharing,
	add data to the volunteer card,
	make requests for volunteers,
	post events,
	manage communications, and so on.
Each volunteer will be associated with multiple organizations, within the reserved area it will be possilbe to view the status of each volunteer report and interact with the organizations. A rating system will allow organizations and volunteers to evaluate each other on a set of parameters that will be defined during the analysis (some of these are: the availability, frequency, personal skills , etc.).

The functions that will be implemented to make the service attractive are the following:

Database management,
	Fund raising,
	Rating,
	volunteers attendance,

After all routine measurements are completed, and provided that the baby is healthy and growing well, 3D/4D pictures of the baby (e.g. face, full body) are done.
All parents enjoy the bonding experienced when they see their baby on 3D/4D imaging. They show them to their relatives, they show them to their friends, they even share them on social networks. They are the first pictures of their baby.
""Easy USE"" (USE stands for UltraSound Enhancement) is an innovative cloud service that processes this ultrasound data to enhance the images, increasing their resolution, making them much more detailed and providing parents with beautiful 3D/4D images of their baby.

Usually (when the baby is healthy) a DVD containing images/videos of the baby is released to the parents, so they can watch it again at home and share it with friends and relatives. The images/videos contained in these DVDs are raw data, because they were made to check that the baby is growing normally. They are intended for medical use during the scan, but after the scan the DVDs are seen by people (which aren't doctors) on their TVs or PCs.

""Easy USE"" offers a way to significantly improve the beauty of this images/videos, acting on resolution and increasing the level of detail automatically.

The Videocv can be downloaded on mobile and internet. The market now developing around videocv is still uncertain and undefined.Present offerings have weak spots: some require a personalized production (agencies and videomakers), restricting therefore the market to areas close to the agencys office. Others have mediocre graphics, uneffective contents;some other consider videocv as an integration of the traditional paper cv, which must be necessarily loaded into the usersaccount and remains necessarily the key tool of job search. MakeVCV is a high quality (graphics and content)product, guiding the user to produce an effective tool, free of traditional logics of paper cv. The ideal customer of MakeVCV is a professional siming at a new challenge.He comes from any work environment. In particular, professionals who want to make themselves known in a new and viral way by potential customers; people wanting a new or improved position;young people, graduated or not, who have the ambition to make their abilities known to companies. The MakeCVC APP will be available in PREMIUM creative version and in a FREE one, that we call VIEWER. The PREMIUM version, obtainable for FEE (payment) can be downloaded on mobile phone and allows creation of personalized video curriculum. After filling a questionnaire/data and selecting graphic elements like colors, characters,music you get a file that is automatically processed by the editing software, programmed to produce a 2 minute max. video. To avoid long waits caused by slow upload and download, the APP offers immediately to the user a sharable link of the video being produced, that will be placed in online repository: in this way the user has the possibility to send a link with a simple touch, obviously in addition to the possibility to download on his own device the full HD video. At the end of the creative process, MakeVCV premium gives the possibility to create a marker to place on his personal card or paper CV. This marker, with the imprinted logo of MakeCVC, will allow , through the AUGMENTED REALITY technology, to view the videoCV in 3D to anybody who had downloaded the VIEWER (free) version of it.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

CROWDARTS main services will focus on two-core moment or stages of artistic creation: the ""Phase"" of the Pre-production and the one of Post-production. The Pre-production is the process of ideation and definition of all the elements involved in a play or other performance acts. The Post-production work is connected with a pre existing product and is dedicated to marketing strategies, communication and sales of a show. CROWDARTS, currently at the idea stage, will leverage on CreatiFI, in order to becomeÿ the first platform providing both Pre and Post-production services and is the first crowdfunding platform offering matchmaking services in the post-production Phase. With CROWDARTS all players will be able to sustain their ideas and will be able to better connect with partners and backers. CROWDARTS will also offer a dynamic environment to test and validate their ideas and to promote and market at low costs their new cultural products. CROWDARTS platform addresses three different primary target groups:

ÿ

ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿÿ- ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿ ÿArtists and Companies;

-ÿÿ ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ Performing Centers, Festivals and professional stakeholders;

-ÿÿ ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ Bakers, audience and Community

ÿ

CROWDARTS offers a cloud platform able to put ideas into motion and create a dynamic ecosystem of cultural actors that could generate new jobs and business opportunities for the ""creators"" and partners of shows. The service will allow artists to connect with partners and backers to accelerate their ideas through all its phases, going from the creation to the programming of the shows and thus promoting the professionalization of the artists internationally. In addition, through the platform, artists will get in touch with a network of partners active in the Performing Arts (spreading centers artistic, performing places, services for artists etc ....) at national and European level.

CROWDARTS, with its partners, will offer a new sustainable model for the sector allowing access to 'alternative' funding and ensuring, via the crowdfunding test, the quality of work and competences of both companies and structures in which they operate. With our platforms we can help mature businesses to transform enabling social and local development connected with artistic production.

ÿ

Our platform, leveraging on partnership and web marketing, will offer a unique crowdfounding reward-based online service, using state-of-the-art ICT technologies, aims to finance the creation ofÿ Pre-production and Post-production Campaigns. CROWDARTS has deep viral approach and will utilise proposers motivation to become very visible in the Performing Arts

During the first two years of life CROWDARTS expects to attract around 1500 crowdfounding campaigns with an average of 150 financed campaigns per year (see section Revenues). Our market will initially be Italy, France and Belgiumand UKand Northern European countries, and in a second place will be translated and spread to the other European countries.

ÿ

Our effort will be concentrated, initially, on theater sector, to broaden to others performing arts sectors.

ÿ

Localization and navigation has become ubiquitous thanks to GPS and its fusion with the mobile technology. Unfortunately GPS does not work inside buildings, because the signal from satellites is shielded and its limited precision makes it irrelevant in a closed space. Increasingly, users are expecting to be able to use GPS-like services inside buildings for their convenience, and businesses are keen on adopting indoor localization to allow a new level of location-aware interaction with customers. GiPStech aims to delivering the technology platform that enables this location-awareness, in a very precise fashion without installing infrastructure.

iCONIC will enable collaborative, self-organising networks for creative industry, where people can connect and build communities to interact with each other and gain from social interaction within their community.

iCONIC will be an open collaborative webspace to realize new products, by exploiting collaborative designÿ enhanced by innovation brought by up to date digital fabrication technologies (i.e. 3D printing) and traditional craftsmanship expertise. iCONIC will be based upon the architecture of WEREALIZE.IT, a crowdfunding/open innovation platform for design, already tested on the market with over 200 users.

The adoption of FIWARE technologies (i.e. the Applications/Services Ecosystems and Delivery Framework Wirecloud) will allow to enhance platform customisation according to specific needs of every single community.

This will allow the creation of ecosystems of creative people, that will maximizes the benefits for all participants: the ecosystem will foster open innovation, improving dialogue and cooperation amongÿ participants involved

iCONIC will offer following functionalities:

User profiling: iCONIC will allow designers and craftsmen to create their own (technical) profile, high lightening up to 3 technical skills.
	Groups: iCONIC will allow users to create small communities to manage working group, created basing on technical skills of users.
	Community/Digital supply chain: iCONIC will enable a network of craftmen that may support collaborate with designers to start small production of their projects.
	Crowdsourcing-contest. Crowdsourcing functionalities will allow SMEs to start ideas or project contest, enabling open innovation processes among SMEs and craftmen/designer communities.
	Crowdfunding: (implemented through original werealize.it framework), will allow designers and craftsmenÿ to start and manage crowdfunding campaign to raise money in support of their projects.
The adoption of FIWARE/ Wirecloud technology will allow users without programming skills to create community of users by selecting and integrate (through simple drag and drop? interaction) only the functionalities needed by every group of users.

The test phase will be carried out involving users from local creative communities. Over the first year of operational activities, the team of werealize.it worked in strict collaboration with all the actors of the addressed value chain (interests of the users community has been clearly stated in EOI official letters). The communities addressed by iCONIC will be

Designers. Over 260 users subscribed to werealize.it. 20% of them are active users and willing to start crowdfunding campaigns. A small panel of design firms will be involved for early validation of new functionalities.
	Craftsmen will be the productive partners in iCONIC model. They will use the platform to start open innovation project with designers and Fablabs. iCONIC will involve a local trade association, Apa Confartigianato, the craftsmen trade association of North Milan area, enclosing members from design, fashion an handicraft. The association is accounting for over 650 companies.
	FABlabs (digital fabrication laboratory) wil be the technological partners of designers and craftsmen . Activities aimed at involving Fablabs have been carried out. The Yatta Fablab (based in Milan) accounting for over 150 members is strongly interested in starting the advanced validation process of iCONIC framework;

At the same time the globalized market and the arrival of web marketers have created the need and demand for such tools. What it is needed is a CMLS that takes into consideration the new devices and content standards such as the wearable devices and UltraHD content. This increases a lot the creative possibilities in publishing contents.

ÿ

The subject of the project is a construction of a CMS / LMS (Content / Learning Management System Software) capable of interfacing with wearable devices that are now on the market, with the use of Ultra HD video projections combined with low budget holographic projection.

ÿ

The project of the drivers for wearable devices must provide the creation of image recognition routines, for this is expected in the business plan the presence of an experienced programmer.

ÿ

By analyzing what happens in the market, while on the one hand the management and content production is having preponderance towards the development of the hardware, and the concepts of information, training and promotion intersect with the use of new media, the development of the LMS softwares remained related of the university/academic approach, dedicated to the satisfaction of administrative needs (classrooms and user management, exams and so on), or facilitated authoring for teachers, that are not interested in acquiring multimedia instruction design skills, so often flatten the content of the online training in textual collections, or PDF file to download.

ÿ

It is surprising that even the newest EDX platform, despite the large universities inside as member of the EDX Committee (MIT, Stanford, etc.), seems decidedly not innovative. In our opinion, the real EDX orientation is to impose a standard of worldwide distribution of content (known as MOOC), to impose a standard training, such as YouTube for general purpose videos.


This surprisingly slow approach still applies even for corporate academies. Quite rarelyÿ companies are aware of the importance of training to better sell their products or services, and invest seriously in content production.

ÿ

The trend however is slowly evolving, driven by the arrival of new personal devices.

Our project has the goal to create something differenciated of what is on the market at the moment, interfacing wearable devices of various kinds with a CMS / LMS that provides, finally, tools for their use.
Obviously, the development of a custom module cannot be exclusive (it is difficult to think of replacing all existing CMS/LMS), and therefore should again be open towards various sources and display instruments, such as:
- proprietary and open source LMS of international relevance
- Wearables devices from different vendors
- UHD screens from different vendors
- Low budget Holographic projection etc.

Therefore the investment in development is not only in the direction of central code but also of plugins and drivers for various devices.",Tech provider,,0,0,0,0,0,,Software,Content Management,Applications,Content Applications,1,X,www.oclab.it,Startup,50000,oclab.it

With millions of songs always available thanks to streaming services, the real challenge is finding an effortless way to create a perfect music selection that satisfies listeners needs.

In this scenario, Smarfle aims at radically innovate the way music listening is experienced by any individual during his daily activities.

ÿ

Our proprietary technology represents a unique mix of smart music recommendation and social playlisting service. It was conceived at first to serve as a personal music concierge to users. The evolution of our product goes now towards the idea of IoT, where smartness is placed in devices, disseminated in our cities, that can seamlessly interact with our smartphones and wearable devices to enable new forms of user experience.

Music will effortlessly accompany us in our daily activities, guaranteeing the perfect atmosphere to go shopping or hanging out with our friends.

We address both consumer and business markets, as there are several ways to deliver our value proposition.

The main concept is that a MusicSpot can be created in places where people listen to background music. Exactly like in a WiFi hotspot the internet bandwidth is shared among user, in a MusicSpot people share their music taste and the music selection can be tailored on their music taste profiles.

For what concerns the consumer market, we?re creating for our users the best solution to enjoy music in a new smart and social way, giving them the possibility to use their favourite streaming service. The strength of our product is that it can be used in a very wide variety of scenarios, from single users who wants to listen to their music in mobility while discovering new artists, to home parties and social events where playlist can be hard to create manually in order to satisfy all people gathering the event.

ÿ

Thanks to the integration of indoor positioning technology we?re going to offer to business owners the most advanced tool to enhance their customers? in-store experience.

Business owners today know that music is very important for them to influence buying behaviour and fidelize customers and members. They will find in our services the most revolutionary automatic tool to tune the music selection on their customers? taste, creating the perfect atmosphere and increasing sales, without paying high rates for a human curated in-store playlisting service.

ÿ

Our Business Model is based on a two main client segments.

B2C customers are all technology passionates that love listening to music, either alone or with friends, but don?t have time to create playlists or discover new songs and artists they could like. We call them ?lazy listeners?. Most of the value proposition will be delivered through mobile/web apps, thus enabling fast scalability, but also dedicated HW solutions will be marketed so to target niches willing to early adopting innovative technologies. Our B2B clients are shops, restaurants and all those commercial activities where music selection is fundamental in terms of social and business opportunity, that are open to new technologies and don?t want to spend too much for human curated music services.

Towards business clients, we?re moving in two directions: direct selling and partnerships (with wifi providers, digital fidelity programs, proximity marketing or contactless payments services). This second option could represent a great opportunity to reduce customers acquisition costs especially in the first period.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

?In simplest terms, ReactiFI is a mobile application. In reality, however, there is very little simple about it. The idea behind ReactiFI is to harness the potential of sensory data gathered from a variety of wearable devices, and use it to create a design that is unique to the user. The result of the design can be anything that we usually design, and it will be shown in real time Augmented Reality environment. A glass or a vase, a sculpture, a piece of furniture, an entire room, or even a whole building!

	Architects.
	Businesses offering design services.
	Artists.

	Licensing to sensor manufacturing companies to sell our product with their proprietary product for a fee.
	Royalty fees for businesses using the service.
	Different subscription plans (personal, professional, corporate).
	Marketplace for users to share their unique designs.
6.ÿCompetitors.

Competition exists, and it consists of companies offering AR applications that can be used for design creation or presentation. However, there is no real competition when it comes to responsive approach to linking the sensor technology and creation of content.

7.ÿChallenges and risks.

Entire concept is based on the idea of wearable device with an integrated sensor being a normal thing for every individual. On one hand, this could prove to be a pitfall of the project, since wearable tech is yet to be an integral part of our lives. On the other hand, according to numbers, it does look like a direction we are moving in. 20 years ago almost nobody had a mobile phone. Similarly, sensors and wearable tech is novelty now, but in 5-10 years it will be a regular thing. IHS Electronics &amp; Media forecasts that the number of wearable devices on the market will rise from 50 million in 2014 to over 180 million by the end of 2017.

8. Competitive advantage.

A disruptive approach to design process. We offer the user a new way of interacting with the existing technologies. This way we are pushing the boundaries of design, changing the way people interact with technology.

Travelers are confused, frustrated and often do not get a chance of experiencing the destination they chose to the fullest. Effort of going through the booking all the necessities is a job of its own (taking care of transportation, accommodation, transits). In addition to that, people have to plan their budgets carefully and then to plan the stay as well. Which walking tour to take? Which museum to visit? Which restaurant serves good local dishes? These all are the questions travelers ask and answers they search for. Getting the best and most updated answers takes time, time they could spend in a better way. That is where 3vell is doing all the work for them, providing them with little bit of extra to the ordinary travel websites, blogs and agencies.
The unique value proposition of 3vell consists of combining few services together in a single platform with a help of a community. We collect big data and process it from open portals like travel news, blogs and social networks, in order to recognize hotspots and pick-up trends. This is going to be the main addition to 3vell's future community. Our algorithms will match people with similar traveling interests, recognize sentiment based patterns, and based on this, propose relevant suggestions (destinations to start with, events and local sights) tailored to each individual. 3vell will offer a possibility to track travel plans, search and discover trends, meet people with similar ideas in terms of destinations desired, preferred type of transportation, time of visiting and budget scope.
We want to make people aware of their time, incent them to travel more often and connect them with like-minded community by reducing all the effort of planning a trip, suiting their own personal preferences, all with the use of clever engineering.
Machine-learning algorithms acquiring current information of trends, popular places and events through big data analysis of open media, will make sure that all the information is always accurate and up-to-date. Sentiment based analysis will provide us with matching personal needs and desires in accordance to our deals. Additionally, open community input is going be one of the key strengths of our business.

Individually it is an useful instrument to help follow a diet or to monitor any kind of food or habits on time people are interested on.

ÿ

Essentially it is a personal nutrition assistant/adviser through a smartphone app and website and a bridge . This application collects food habits information graphicallyÿ from users; then it recognize basic food habits analysing historic data, and finallyÿ give suggestions considering the most general nutrition suggestions of OMS and other international nutrition authorities. In order to learn simple good eating habits, the app will propose real time tips day by day in order to obtain results gradually.ÿ

ÿ

User interface will be simple, useful and attractive. initially asking users their own food habits in a graphical way, with a personalized detail level that depends on the individual needs, objectives and involvement. Considering the data collected, nutrition algorithm will elaborate identifying some basic nutrition habits like:

- How many times a day/week I eat, I have eaten vegetables and fruit or milk or beans (low detail basic level)

- Approximately, how much grams of animal proteins I have ate this week? (high level of detail)

ÿ

Then nutrition algorithm will ask user which of the habits will like to change (for example eat 5/6 times/day or eat few candies) and the level of interaction user want (few, lot of questions, level detail desidered basic or advanced). PA will give suggestions and continue asking user his eating habits and then present the achievement of objectives with the desired frequency. User can show his eating habits to a professional nutritionist, helping them to understand patient food habits, and advertising this application. A game interface will permit or deny permission to take dessert based on awareness and discipline. Social function will permit to share experiences between users with similar profile or problems.

ÿ

Particularly important: the application will suggest to visit a professional to obtain a personalized diet for complicated cases or to receive an initial brief feedback from a Nutritionist. User then can decide to contact a nutritionist certifiedÿ (there will be a process for this verification) located near the actual geographic position. Nutritionist can visualize and follow nutrition habits from their patients through app or website; then nutritionists can provide a diet through the application. Patients can receive direct assistance from his own nutrition specialist, and help to follow a diet. Nutritionist can also modify diet based on results, patient feedbacks and specific changing needs. Patients will receive a better service from nutritionist through this solution and nutritionist can retain and increase number of patients.

ÿ

Another module of the solution will elaborate, anonymize and aggregate information, and then share this information using open data formats. In this way, food habits of digital citizens will become available for scientific community and health ministry of countries as additional useful reference for nutrition programs.Other developers will be able to use this information in the future to create new applications, to correlate data for example to make big data processing to understand better relationships between health and nutrition.

That is the way it will be able to work as a great fully functional tablet or desktop system. This device aims the satisfaction of maximum users which will lead to be used for a long-term planning. Because of the uniqueness of its functions could not be replaced by another device in the near future.

Form

Maximum simplicity of the shape of that device is for easier hold in a hand. Therefore the width of the screen in the folded position coincides with outside dimension of the device. Thus easy to grip even with 7-inch diagonal single screen but when unfolded there is no distance between screens and practically becomes a device with three times larger screen.

Impact

The device that combines the capabilities of Smart phone and functionality of PC. Daily use of computers is unarguably. Also we need for continuous telephone and internet connection. This device combines all these functions in one body. When folded it is just a mobile phone / tablet. Unfolded allows use as a PC- bigger screen and more precise work with applications for Office, web, vector and raster design, 3D, CAD and etc.

Context

Benefits of design is for all-from students to people with different occupations. You do not need to carry cell phones, tablets, notebooks.

Proofy is a cloud-based web application that allowsÿusers to get a certificate of the date of creation of their copyrightable work. Target users are artists, creative people and software developers who want to protect their original works.

Users have to upload files containing their copyrightable work and receive a certificate with a proof of the existence and integrity of such files to a certain date and time.

Data and time of registration are guaranteed by mean of the application of a certified timestamp, and integrity proof of of the uploaded file is implemented by mean of an ad hoc technology, which constitutes the added value of the service we provide.

In fact, thanks to the implementation of authenticated data structures, Proofy can verify if a file/certificate has been cracked; the verification system is integrated in Proofy, and offers security levels that are consistently higher than the ones offered byÿcompetitors since it has been developedÿon the basisÿofÿan innovative technology that is still a field of academic research.

Timestamps are certified by a Certification Authority legally recognised at European level.

ÿ

How it works

The user is clearly identified during the sign-up process. Since Proofy cannot verify neither legally certifyÿif the uploader is the author of the file he uploads,ÿwe ask the userÿfor aÿstatement of authorship which is considered as simple reinforced proof of the authorship. It will be possible to add co-authors or, for B2B customers, to register on behalf of someone else.

Each file shall be eitherÿkept private or published in a web space of the Proofy websiteÿnamed ""Gallery"", and/or in other web-platforms such as social networks or personal websites, which will show the viewer to a link to the certificate,ÿin order to prevent plagiarism. Our service is compatible with Creative Commons Licences.

During the trial period the service willÿprovide the user withÿ5 free uploads. In order to keep using the service,ÿeachÿcustomerÿwill have to choose one of the subscription plans, which will allow him to accessÿto further contents and benefits (e.g. access to additional information materials, discounts on services of selected partners etc.).

Besides, Proofy offers a secure back-up system for files and certificates stored in its Archives.

ÿ

Proofy's technology

Proofy is currently based on windows Azure cloud computing service at IAAS level (Infrastructure As A Service).

On that basis, six componentsÿare beingÿimplemented:

-ÿÿÿÿÿÿ java based web application, that is, the user's interface side;

-ÿÿÿÿÿÿ component used to communicate with the Certification Authority, used by Proofy toÿtimestamp files;

-ÿÿÿÿÿÿ the new java based data integrity system that offers high security levels;

-ÿÿÿÿÿÿ communication infrastructure between components based on non-syncronized messaging ,in order to guarantee the service even in the case that one component is not available in a certain moment;

-ÿÿÿÿÿÿ a graph database for managing digital certificates;

- ÿ ÿ ÿ object database to manage media files

-ÿÿÿÿÿÿ a traditional database for managing users and payment plans (both spot and recurring).

A possible future development for the serviceÿmay beÿthe authomatic research of plagiarism cases of uploaded files.",Tech provider,,X,0,0,0,0,,Software,Authoring and Publishing Software,Applications,Content Applications,1,0,www.proofy.co,Startup,50000,proofy.co

The new players in this field are the creative minds (industrial designers, architects, graphic designers, artists etc.) who are open to learn and take advantage of a new process of fabrication. Only those professionals who have a full understanding of digital software tools are able to express their potential and to be competitive, bringing innovative products to market in a smart and cost efficient way. Nowadays the creativity of many people remains hidden and unexpressed because of the steep learning curve in mastering 3D modeling applications, only few can cover this gap and access additive manufacturing hardware technology.

The aim of this project is to reduce the gap existing between digital and physical fabrication process through the implementation of a user friendly 3D data navigation and manipulation protocol. There are 3 tools playing a key role in the digital craftsman?s laboratory: 3D modeling software packages and 3D printing/scanning hardware. The integration of these technologies requires skills and know-how.

Our business idea consists of a web-based platform which will enable 3D modelers to connect with creative minds in order to translate their ideas into physical models and thereby empowering a business relationship. The process of taking a design concept from its original sketch to its final shape requires a lengthy workflow of exchanging information and data between the designer and the 3D modeler. The physical distance between the two makes communication not only time consuming, but also costly. At present, the exchange of information is mostly carried out by verbal communication, email attachments and with personal meetings. The main limitation of this process lies in the difficulty of not being able to display, modify, render and discuss actions and issues related to the model in real-time.

Therefore we are proposing a cost-effective way of designing and co-creating digital models, in a synchronized way, within a shared digital workspace which is not bound to the software used by the modeler and is independent from the physical location of the involved partners and of the production facilities.

The platform will on one side offer software applications to its subscribers, on the other intermediate between the 3D scanning/printing service providers. Our community members will benefit from this all-in-one offer as they will deliver a complete service to their customers.

The software package we intend to use and that will be at the core of our web-based services is FIWARE, this can be further developed and potentially re-sold as a new API, transferrable to different business sectors.

We forecast the usage of this service principally, but not only, by two categories of users: 3D printing enthusiasts who approach this technology for the first time and need full support for taking their design idea to production and designers who know the technology but do not know how to properly use the software tool best suited for their project. On the other hand we hypothesize that there will be two types of platform experts who will offer their competences as a service: technical 3D modelers who will make models following the client?s specification and 3D modelers who will also offer their personal design style for improving aesthetically, functionally or ergonomically the outlook of the product. Each modeler registered on the platform will have a dedicated profile showing products, projects and ratings received by her/his clients.",Tech provider,,0,0,0,0,0,,Software,Mechanical Computer-Aided Design,Applications,Engineering Applications,1,0,#N/A,Startup,50000,0

I?m a graphic designer and I love visual books. Designers are constantly look for visual books. Design manuals, rarities, monographs, classics, catalogs.

They don?t just look for them. They dream on them. And they need ?em for work and for study.

The last time I was in a design library I passed one hour in, just because it?s an immersive and a beautiful experience.

ÿ

The problem is that theese books are not online. There is no digital version of them.

It's impossible to digitize them because they are special. They have different papers, transparencies, emboss finishes, special paints. So they are impossible to translate in a digital product.

ÿ

The solution

The solution is an interactive visual library for designers, artists, photograpers and architects. It?s called Spine.

ÿ

The process

We take design books in consignment from publishers. We take Hi Res pictures of all pages of the books and we transform them into a ebooks. So a real book becomes an Hi quality ebook. The photo process show details that normally are hidden in standard ebooks. This digital product It's provided with a user interface. You can zoom, search, browse. And you can read it as well. It is a unitary product and it's marketable as a standard ebook.

ÿ

Online.

Registred users can enjoy the Ebooks we make for 15 minutes for free as in a normal bookshop. (Time limit.)

If they want they can have a premium account for a 15 ? / monthly fee or buy the single ebook.

70% goes to Spine and 30% goes to publishers in proportions to the number of pages visited.
The model is different from Spotfy because there is no ads in here. It's an ""All You Can Eat"" business model.

ÿ

Premium users can enjoy the whole library on every platform. 

Publishers, on the other side, can directly relate with an online community and an international niche receptive to the purchase of the hard copy of the original books. This operation will be facilitated and promoted by Spine.

We are also acting as dropshipers for the purchase of the hardcopy of the books.

For the first six months Spine will contracts with publishers interested in the project.ÿ 

We have strong validation of interest with a few number of them.

The goal will be to photograph and digitize 300 titles in the first 8 months.

Friendipity allows you to share your public appointments and events, letting your friends know what you are going to do and, if they want, join you. Or, at the opposite, it allows you to join your friends if they are going to do something interesting.

There are similar working-based tools, useful to organize meetings with your co-worker team, eg. Outlook, Google calendar, iCal, Lotus, but none of these is thought for free time.

ÿ

In a busy world, where social networks have imposed almost exclusively virtual relations, Friendipity wants to reinstate the real ones.

How many times have we missed hanging out with friends because we didn?t know their plans? How many times did this happen because we didn?t have time to text or call them?

ÿ

Reaching a large part of our friends to know or to let them know the reciprocal plans, forces us to write countless sms (in countless whatsapp groups), or to make lots of calls, which is sometimes boring and other times hard to do (when we are at work, at school, or at the university).

ÿ

Friendipity solves all these problems, letting people know what will happen around them. It won?t be only a virtual window on our friend?s life, satisfying our curiosity, but, more consistently, it will push us to get out and be more active in the real life, knowing immediately what our friends are going to do. We will then avoid regrets, like knowing too late, from the social networks, that we missed something nice that some friends did/organized the night/day before, while we could have been there if we knew it.

ÿ

The will to integrate social-networks into real life is not new: companies like Facebook (Nearby Friends), Google (ex Google Latitude) and Foursquare (Swarm), are trying to achieve this goal focusing only on the ?here and now?, with a check-in on a map. Well, like this it?s too late! When I check-in, I?m already doing something and I don?t allow my friends to know in advance where I am, to reach me. Otherwise, when I see someone else checking-in, it might be too late to reach him. Friendipity, on the contrary, lets people know in advance what friends are planning, to ?carpe diem? any occasion.

Furthermore, in the existing social networks, the single user has often a community of contacts too big (way over the relationships one is able to manage) to feel confortable in sharing such private information as location and schedules. Friendipity is, instead, designed for smaller groups of real friends.

ÿ

Friendipity could also help: (1) giving you a chance to meet with a girl or a boy you are interested in, knowing where She/He is going to be (being particularly careful with privacy issue), (2) allowing you to meet friends who live abroad, who are in the nearby for work/holiday for just a few days, (3) simplifying the family routine (I know a couple that use one spreadsheet in Google Drive to know the partner?s appointments to schedule their own agenda), (4) managing amateur or professional sport team?s appointments and presence during the season.

ÿ

Friendipity will be almost always used in mobility. That?s why we started developing the App for iOS (XCode), using Parce for managing the backend, and we will proceed for Android.

in this way We will help the industry to optimize its investments.
We will support the young filmakers and their crews to personalize the best feedback to create successful films.
We will give the users the possibility to share emotional and educational experiences as well.

In the long term:
Identify, co-produce, and produce successful films including the community whether through crowdsourcing and crowfounding.

The main aim of this project it's not simply present an idea to the audience and involve them, but try to understand the unconscious that creates this story in the audience and merge this unconscious as much as possible with the author's one.ÿ We want to Achieve this by Identifying a list of key visual images and semantic codes specifically created on each movie genre and subgenre.

PizzaUp is an application designed for the electronic management of orders in the scope of take-away pizzas.

Currently pizzerias are having to manage a considerable number of phone orders, often resulting in a substantial waste of time.

On the other hand, ordering by phone for customers may result cumbersome. In fact it may be difficult to retrieve information about the pizzeria, for example the timetable, phone number or its menu.ÿ In this case it is required a web search to retrieve the information for contacting the pizzeria, then a phone call is required for knowing the menu. This results in a waste of time for both customer and pizzeria.

PizzaUp is a system that aims to embrace both the needs of pizzerias and of customers.

ÿ

Benefits for pizzerias:

increase the visibility thanks to the presence of a map that will show all pizzerias in a given area;
	ability to create an introductory page in which to describe their menu, timetable and all the information to share with customers;
	time optimization: the order will be displayed on a tablet by which the pizzeria will be able to get all information about the order such as the identity of the customer, location, delivery time etc. It will be possible to decide whether to accept or reject or delay the order;
	recognition of the identity of the client so that it can be reported as ""unwanted"" in case of any jokes or abuse of service;
	the order will be printed by POS printer in order to speed up the process of ordering;
	improve its services by analyzing the reviews written by customers;
	opportunity to promote special events (e.g. happy hour) directly on the smartphone customer opening a new promotional channel at low cost.
ÿ

Benefits for customers:

opportunity to get the menu of every pizzeria and to customize the pizzas (if allowed by the pizzeria);
	ability to search for a pizza place according with several criteria, such as the availability of gluten-free foods;
	ability to hide the restaurants that are not currently opened;
	reduce the time of the ordering process because of the immediate availability of all the needed information;
	customers can place their order from smartphones, tablets, and PCs in whatever place they are (even if they are not able to perform a call, e.g. office, university classes, trains or crowded places);
	no call charges to place an order;
	opportunity to discover new pizzerias when moving in non-habitual locations;
	to review the various pizzerias and read the reviews written by other customers.
ÿ

The team of PizzaUp will provide in loan to each pizzeria:

a tablet for managing orders;
	a printer for commands;
	a few months of service;
	flyers to promote the service.
ÿ

After the first period in which PizzaUp service will be free, every pizzeria will have to bear the cost of this service (flat fee or per usage).

It will be possible to advertise pizzerias by banner ad, in order to introduce more users into their business. This banner will entail costs, which will be significantly lower than the cost required by printing and distributing flyers.

ÿ

We will use the technologies proposed by Fi-Ware (in particular the Virtualization) in order to implement the services of data-storage and computing required by the system.

In addition, all non-sensitive data will be made public through appropriate API (also implemented via Fi-Ware) to expand the context in which they can be used (Open Data).

A concrete example could be data-mining on the tastes of the customers clustered by geographical areas or ethnic groups, but there are tons of possible usages.

Video and picture, instead, did not change the way you access and interact with: these are still tied up with the old and traditional journalistic and television broadcasting model where the users are merely passive.

The Wrapping Reality project is aimed at changing this approach, producing immersive, user-centered multimedia content, enhancing the users interaction in media material fruition. The resulting experience is hence much more engaging and exciting, transmitting the desired message in an efficient and effective way. Arrays of High Definition (HD) cameras will produce panoramic (360 degrees) and spheric (360 x 360 degrees) pictures and video streams, both two dimensional (2DWR) or three dimensional (3DWR). These can be reproduced either by various traditional or new conception devices type, providing users with innovative and addictive experiences.

The main goal ÿof the Wrapping Reality(WR) project is the development of a complete workflow, starting from video acquisition, terminating with user content exploration and including all the intermediate steps like panoramic content processing and management.

Cameras arrays together with sensor sets like accelerometers and gyroscopes allow to link the acquired content with a specific and precise geographical location. Furthermore it is possible to process the acquired content by means of advanced image processing techniques, adding additional information or applying a stack of custom developed special effects (SFX). In the latest stage of the project efforts will be made to the implementation of image stabilization and enhancement SFX ÿlike Hyper-Lapse and High Dynamic Range (HDR).

Remote storage and streaming technique are high priority developments, together with 2DWR and 3DWR real time broadband broadcasting technologies.

The recorded content is suited for a multitude of input-output stimulus arrangements. The navigation in space and time along the recorded ?panoramic video tunnels? (PVTs) will be performed by means of mouse and keyboard combination, joystick/gamepad devices but also utilising innovative motion detection devices like Leap Motion or Microsoft Kinect. Natural interaction techniques are much more intuitive, attractive and capable of catalyzing the attention of users. Virtual reality head-mounted displays like Oculus Rift will complete the user experience immersing users in an insulated full-field-of-view virtual world.

It is possible an input method on mobile devices touchscreens but, considering the user-surrounding nature of the WR content, move the digital world viewport using information provided by gyroscopes and accelerometers will result in appreciable user experience. The market release of add-ons like Samsung Gear Vr or the simpler Google CardBoard permit a Oculus-like experience, as well as cheaper and wireless.

Concurrent multi-user collaboration and interaction along the PVTs is possible, being the content stored on remote servers and streamed on demands. The server knows the exact viewing position of all the active users and can share this information with a group of collaborators: each user can be aware of the PVT portion other users are looking at. The union with a voice or text chat produce an efficient and entertaining environment exploration tool.

Being the PVT fully georeferenced it can be enriched with additional information about the captured environment (points of interests/POIs). Interactive elements linked to well defined position of the PVT will appear during the users experience, enabling interaction with additional information in order to increase knowledge about the object or to trigger specific actions.

It is possible to exploit the great amount of recorded data producing video edits featured with unique special effects like strong stabilization, time freezing, great changes in camera field of view and spatial re-projection. The resulting videos are intended for a passive vision on standard monitors, although and even better results can be appreciated on autostereoscopic 3D ones having great impressing and attracting ability.

The whole processes chain involved in the project implies the generation and processing of a big amount of digital data, the development of many web services and the design of some user interfaces and applications; FIWARE enablers ecosystem capabilities will simplify and speed up the prototyping phase, while FI-lab will allow fast testing and experimentation of the developed components.

There seems that, smart city citizens live their lives by time-stamping their moments with a photo and post it to social sites.ÿDigiFIÿwill create a FIWARE based service that will offer incentives to everyday users for sharing digital artefacts that they use or produce. DigiFI will form an added value art business model by definingÿthe future Internet copyright and micro-payment service model for FI producers and consumers of digital art over the public Internet. We aim to develop FIWARE services:

Allowing digital art (images, paintings, 3d objects, 3D artifacts, archeological artifacts, and other) that captured and shared by Smart City users in their everyday activities to be easily delivered to interested parties over FIWARE technology.
	Supporting augmented reality features to increase representation detail.
	Defining copyrights on the fly that could be used from 3rd party users, applications or services on demand and on pay-as-you-go model.
	Processing automatic payments via a number of payment methods, eg. PayPal.
	Monitoring of increasing usage, ratings and popularity of digital objects will ensure quality of service.
	Monitoring usage of Google Alert will prevent content theft and will notify for unregistered usage of digital objects.
The idea is rather simple but with high potentials and desribed as follows:

A user (known as a producer) takes a photo and post it to social site (e.g. using instagram API)
	A consumer uses the DigiFI-Art service to register the photo, define copyrights and micro-payment mode (e.g. using paypal API). Consumer will use the copyrights (set by producer) on demand, define subscription period and make use of the photo on demand.ÿThe DigiFI system will generate the location (URI) of the photo (in JSON format to be incorporated automatically within his/her application using the REST protocol) along with a token that is valid for one month so the consumer uses the photo within his/her application.
	Consumer users browses photos from the service, and selects to use it based on a subscription period (e.g. use the photo for a small cost).
	DigiFI is responsible for maintaining revenue distribution among parties using a publish subscribe broker. Also it providesÿpatterns and rules for event management (e.g. increasing usage of objects will affect related costs, Complex Event Processingÿwill identify such patterns and will provide rules).
	The sustainability of the project is high since automatic business flows will allow payments to be made to digiFI in terms of a small percentage, and rest will go to the photo owner. Other 3rd party service providers e.g. paypal etc. will be paid according to their usage by the DigiFI-Art based on usage.ÿ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Ioanni Xenou 38, 73100 Chania, Greece",Consumer other,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Stelios Sotiriadis,"NotiFI is a Future Internet project to expand the news distribution brokering market. Specifically, it is aÿNews Subscription service that allows News Brokers (Information Producers) to easily publish their news in form of text, images, sound and video while News Consumers could be subscribed and get data dynamically and on demand. We are motivated by the openings arising and the possibilities of applying FI technology in this field by offeringÿpurpose build instantiations of the NotiFI service.ÿThe service will offer:

a) Instant publication of the news while subscribers receive content dynamically in the form of a subscription to a RESTFul service.

b) Instant access to material for registered consumers and reactive payment settlement among brokers and consumers based on a dynamic revenue settlement service.

c) Transformation of news to API in terms of categorization of information and exposition of interfaces based on the REST protocol. It will be aÿcloud platform service to act as an API for third party applications, services and users.

d) Cloud based modular structure of the system to ensure elasticity and flexibility. Developers implementing new solutions or already existing news systems (web sites, applications, mobile apps etc.) could use the NotiFIÿservice to allow interaction of consumers, yet by simple calling the API to get information on the form of aÿlightweight data-interchange format (e.g. JSON).

e) Identification of user needs and trends, information that will be offered to Brokers as a Service in order to assist them to increase businesses and identify target users.

ÿ

The following scenario demonstrates the business idea and the revenue flows.

a) A News Broker register to the NotiFI service and gets a token for remote communication. At this stage the Information Producer setup the payment data (e.g. by PayPal to receive income) while makes a payment to the DigiFI service for usage.

b) Using the token it publish news to the NotiFI service:

ÿ ÿ - By using the NotiFI platform orÿ

ÿ ÿ - By calling the NotiFI service remotely using the token

c) Information Consumers register also to the NotiFI platform and pay the fees for usage.

d) Select the information they want to be subscribed (by browsing categories e.g. each time an article about technology will be published a RESTFul based service will update the content of the consumer application or system).

e) The Consumer pays the subscription fees to the NotiFI service that arranges the payments with the Broker. The first period (e.g. 6-12 months) NotiFI service will be offered as free of charge to News Brokers in order to provide motives for usage.

f) The Consumer gets a token that it is valid until the end of the subscription and it is associated with the Broker and the categories that the Consumer selected at previous steps.

ÿ

NotiFI service has already identifies a News Broker and a number of Consumers based on the GoodNews.gr system that is the first journalistic agency in Greecewith good news. In particular, GoodNews.gr will be the use case of the NotiFI project in order to demonstrate effectiveness and reach target market within a small amount of time. NotiFI will expand GoodNews.gr system to offer:

a) Integration with other systems: An efficient API to integrate the systems and run business more efficiently.ÿ

b) To take control: The NotiFIÿAPI will provide the tools for subscribers to interface into news and personalize their systems according to the things that better suits their needs.

c) Engage customers and vendors: NotiFI will provideÿan API in other systems to allow Consumers (and their applications) to make minor tweaks without the costly expenditures of buying new software.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Crafters, designers and manufacturing companies (from now on they are called Suppliers) can use the platform in the following way:

ÿ

They upload their products to the platform using a simple excel file (in MVP phase) ro by using our API.
	They set the price they want to get for the products.
	They select which countries and languages they would like to sell their products in.
	They let us know whether they would like to use their own logistics solution or the one offered by Sellysium.com.
	They submit all information and they are done.
ÿ

Once a supplier submits the product information, our platform sends all the texts and descriptions to a partner company, who make sure that these are translated to all selected languages by native speakers.

After the translations are in place, the products appear in the listing on our platform where web shop owners (from now on: Merchants) can see them.

ÿ

On the other side of the value chain there are the web shop owners, who would like to widen their product portfolio, or harness the power of cross selling, but who do not have the option to purchase a large amount of inventory upfront.

ÿ

Merchants have to register to our platform, and integrate our APIs to their own web shop. For major web shop rental platforms like Shopify.com they do not have to do the integration as our modules can already be found in the system and we can also provide them with modules for the most widely used web shop and CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, etc.

ÿ

When the integration is done, the merchant simply logs into our system and browses the products available in their country. When she selected the products she actually wants to display in her web shop, she updates the price with her profit and saves the changes.

ÿ

The selected product immediately appears in her web shop through our API and is available for customers to be purchased. When an order is placed for a product the API notifies the Sellysium platform about the purchase so that can forward the order to the supplier. In the meantime our platform sends all the order details to the selected logistics partner which will send a courier for the package by the given time and delivers it to the customer.

ÿ

There are two main options to monetize the solution.

ÿ

Suppliers pay a small, 5% commission fee after all sales that they received through the platform.
	Merchants can be charged for a monthly fee depending on the number of products they wish to display in their store.
ÿ

On the long run there are many different ways to extend the platform and its incomes. In case there are many products in certain product categories, we can introduce a model where Suppliers pay for highlighting their products on the top of the listing.

ÿ

A different approach for the platform extension is a vertical expansion. In this case we can offer the platform to many different industries. From the very beginning we designed the platform in a way that it can easily be adjusted in case of a pivot of the target audience.

ÿ

It does not matter if the Suppliers are hotels who want to sell hotel bookings and Merchants are travel agencies, or the Suppliers are event organizers who sell tickets for concerts and other events, and the Merchants are different ticket portals.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Have you have had to drive you grandmother grocery shopping because she can?t drive? Did you need to change your plans to do this? Perhaps when you arrived at the shop you met somebody leaving in her neighborhood?what if he could have given a lift to her or better, buy all the things she needed himself and then carry the bags directly to her places stopping by on the way back!

Is the closest shop 10km far away from your home and you currently can?t go shopping that far? Perhaps your neighbor can.

These situations are commonly experienced by people living in mountain territories, where small towns lack of shops and to reach the closest ones you need to climb down with your car to the valley below. But what if you don?t have a car nor the possibility to go shopping? Usually you need your relatives to help you and come all the way up to your place; you don?t want to bother a neighbor for that, even though he goes up and down the valley everyday to go to work. In principle, he could carry some bags for you once he goes shopping for himself, thing that he has to do anyway at some point of the week. Wouldn?t it be helpful?

Our idea is to create a web application (and the corresponding mobile version) in the form of a web platform where residents of mountain villages that need to go shopping but can?t for any kind of mobility problems, can find other residents leaving nearby that offer their help going shopping for the previous ones. These volunteers will then deliver the bags directly at the home of the people who requested the help. The idea is that these volunteers have to go shopping for themselves anyway at some point of the week, therefore if we manage to get them involved and propose their help we could then match needs and helps so to optimize the action of going grocery shopping for both of the two parties involved.

The main objective of our service is thus to offer all sorts of web features that could allow the establishment and the optimal implementation of these solidarity exchanges between people who need and people who offer their help to perform the basic need of grocery shopping.

The customers of our service are two types: shoppers, who need to be delivered shopping bags; volunteers, who offer to go shopping and then deliver the bags on the way back. We will denote by user either of the two, meaning a general user of our service. From now on we will use these two terms with the meaning we just defined above.

Examples of main features our platform might use are: register and authenticate users; provide a request form for people who need help and a corresponding form to write the list shop they need; provide a search for users based on given criteria; propose deals and offers provided by local shops; estimate shop list cost and gasoline expenses.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

MARKET

Growth in the European Fashion Market is driven by e-commerce: +77% in the last 4 years vs a 4% increase in the total fashion market. Luxury online fashion is forecasted to increase by 20% CAGR. Looking forward over the next four years, eCommerce sales penetration will accelerate to 10% in 2016 that is about four times the rate of traditional retail sales. This inflection will be driven by high-growth emerging markets such as Russia and Latin America as well as the destabilization of specialty retail in developed markets, particularly within the US and Australia. Total Addressable Market for online fashion is 34bn Euro for the European Market. (Data by Morgan Stanley and Eurostat)

ÿ

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

In Italythere are around 80,000 SMEs in the fashion industry ÿin the textile and leather sectors and 35% of the available machines are not in use (ISTAT). This unused capacities are caused by two main factors:

1) The competition of the cheap&amp;chic sector has caused a war on price that is not helping the recovery

of the industry after the last two years in decline.

2)Collapse of internal demand. Indeed, over the last 5 years internal market has decreased by 20%. However the positive trend is that exports have increased by 38% and they will rise to 76% by 2015.

To boost this trend, TailorItalyexploits Made in Italyfashion districts quality of material, expertise and unused resources giving them a new Business Channel to scale their revenues. ÿ

There are millions of tourists and travelers which travel around the world. However the need for communication is very essential in the destination countries for tourists or foreigners. The real assistance of human interpreters is needed especially in situations where the foreigner needs help with the doctor, police, even shopping or other possible situations. This is where interpreting companies come to the play. Though, the current outdated and complicated manual operation model that current interpreting companies have, does not allow them to assist individuals. Hiring private interpreter for tourists and travelers is very costly and difficult.

ÿ

We have a solution that can solve all above mentioned issues, and connect tourists or foreigners to interpreters easily. ICS, can make this process cheaper and at the same time quicker for both interpreter companies and individual travelers. ICS is the service which gives the ability to tourists or any other individual or organization that need language assistance. In this system, customer can search for the desired language that he/she is looking for and book the available interpreter for specific time by just few clicks or touch of mobile phone. The interpreters are getting feedback from customers that can help other customers to choose easily the best interpreters. Moreover, the feedback can help the owners of interpreting companies to increase their quality. 

ÿ

Customers can pay by most common payment methods through the service or for organizations there is possibility of monthly invoicing. ICS, stays in the middle of interpreting companies, and customers which can reduce the use of operators in the current interpreting company systems, and consequently reduce the cost and increase efficiency. 

ÿ

In the current interpreting business model, customer should call to the interpreting company and ask for an interpreter, then the interpreting company should call the interpreter and ask for his/her availability and then call back the customer to inform whether there is available interpreter or not. However this is not efficient and time consuming for both parties, which ICS tries to solve it. With ICS, all the operations happens automatically and everything becomes computerized. ÿ

The portable System Set, already developed and functioning in laboratory environment, is composed of several ?Docking Plates? above which are attached the different cameras and audio recorders involved in the video recording session. The inexpensive servo-assited Docking Plates allow the cameras to automatically frame and focus the person(s) talking in the conference. The main achievement of the System Set resides, besides in its low price, in the fact of being able to collect information generated in the room (movements, noise, light shifts, etc) and convert it into parameters (metadata) which then make possible an automated edition with all the recorded material. Manual edition costs become therfore inexistent. Furthermore, after the video edition has been automatically accomplished, the conferences are directly uploaded to a server where the collaborative service is offered. 

The Service ?basically? consists on a web platform that motivates collaborative transcriptions and translations of the videos by means of involving stakeholders of cultural entities. The intellectual involvement is accomplished by offering different types of remuneration (not only economical) to the targeted stakeholders. From tiny chops of transcriptions to complete translations, Stakeholders (Users, visitors, workers from the different cultural entities...) are invited to collaborate on an always growing legate of well indexed cultural videos. 

The collaborative spirit shall only be possible if the videos of the different entities are all in the same web page thus making the one site a reference for all human beings who look for well indexed videos from experts willing to share their knowledge. In order to gather the different and diverse cultural entities in the same video platform, several studied issues have been taken into consideration. The three and most important opportunities that have to be clearly given to the potential Users (Corporations, Cultural entities and their stakeholders) are:
1) an undeniable money saver method in the recording and edition workflow for the corporations
2) an undeniable time saver method in the process of both indexing material (Entities) and finding interesting material (Users) 3) an elegant method for corporations to demonstrate to the public their concern for cultural issues (canalisation of CSR). 

While the recording and edition workflow is certainly optimised by the ""Docking Plates"", the indexing process is facilitated as follows: the adoption by the Cultural Entities of the web video platform does not begin in the process of assisting the uploading of the media but rather in a much earlier stage, that is, from the moment the Entity is planning the Event. Thus, by the time the video is ready to be uploaded, there is no need to fill in again all the data involved in that item in order to have all the data well indexed (authors, sponsors, language, place...): The metadata is already in the video file when it?s time to show it online.ÿ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Its main feature is providing restaurant menu directly to clients smartphonesÿ and receiving orders from them. This functionality is achieved by using Bluetooth markers, called beacons or simply by internet connection combined with GPS, built-in clients mobile devices. Both options will be connected with mobile application. This application will provide also few own features.

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

First option is ?passive?, which means we can only show information without getting feedback. But, because of used technology it will be easy to connect with for clients, it won?t be necessary to have internet connection for clients or restaurant and it will be much more ?cool?. Also, because of low range of Bluetooth transmitters it will be possible to match different information in different places of restaurant. For example, near bar clients could receive only information about drinks and beverages.

ÿ

Second option offers much more flexibility. We plan to use GPS to automatically select right restaurant in client app. So, client simply goes into restaurant, starts our app and receives full information about served dishes, drinks, etc. He could then make his order, pay using online payment system and just wait. His order will be shown in restaurant kitchen.

ÿ

Those two systems could be combined. If we will have both of them installed in restaurant, we could send to kitchen more information like number of table which client chooses, without asking him about it.

ÿ

We plan to show information in attractive way to clients. Every position in menu will be supplemented by information about its history, how much calories it contains or even its recipe, if only chef gives permission for that. Another feature we plan to add is making favourite dishes list in application, which will allow clients to make orders even quicker in future.

Its a platform that has intensely waited for its makers. Finally both professional artists and collectors, together with local residents and travellers, are able to find the best art around, intuitively and humanely.

ÿ

The map based platform is intuitive, fast and stylish. With it you can find close by museums, galleries and art events and all their basic information where ever you are. The complete art world of Europe is easily accessible, and easy to integrate to your travel plans. Its not just a search tool to find galleries, but a fully functional and new social platform, that aims to connect artists, art lovers, buyers and parties presenting art with each other. The application will make many conventions in the field obsolete, paper invitations and expensive and ineffective mass mailings will be a thing of the past. Email mailing lists will also get an upgrade, when the current mails of followed galleries and museums can be read straight from the service. You will never again miss an opening or the final days of a show.

ÿ

In addition to the application giving a quick glance of what is happening right now and where, there will also be sections for journalistic content and writings of art critique. In the current situation major newspapers and seldom published art journals have too much power over art criticism. And as a counterforce there has during the past years been published numerous online blogs that are specialized in writings on art. Our aim is to integrate the writings from these blogs as part of the application, in this way you can not only get the practical information for an exhibition, but also a critics review and comments from other users. In the longer run this will create an archive and a database on artists and their exhibitions. An archive that is accessible through the application long after the exhibition is over.

ÿ

The service will also give the art consumer an opportunity to raise there voice and express their opinion, hopefully inspiring other to experience art. We are currently researching different ways of integrating Facebook and Instagram as part of the application, enabling users to easily share interesting images and content related to art with each other. Encouraging the consumption of art as part of everyday life is our greatest wish! Maybe not least because we are active artists ourselves.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Sillanpaankatu 2 A 4, 06100 Porvoo, Finland",Horizontal (solutions suitable for every verticals),0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,VItalyStockman,"I would like to develop a solution for two real problems that have been validated by my own experience and by results of my master thesis research:

ÿ

Today, it is challenging process to book business venue for an event such as training workshop, presentation, networking or social event, conference or other types ofÿevents. First, oneÿhas to do research e.g. online to find suitable venues; then these venues need to be manually contacted by E-mail or by phone; only after someÿwaiting for responses and more contacting a booking can be made. On average, this process requires making 5 calls just to check availability and pricing information and overall takes from several hours to several days of time.
	ÿ
	Second problem is even bigger, affects well-being and happiness of society because it is related to efficient use of existing resources and ability to access desired resources: Today's average occupancy rate of business venues is only 40%. Most of the time venues are vacant.
ÿ

What these problems tell is that on one side, clients may not be booking as much as they wish because of difficulty or process; on other side, venues managers are not renting their spaces as much as wish, because of lack of good simple to use tools.

ÿ

Venue.Today is meant to solve the gap by introducing existing technologies, similar to the ones that are used to make real-time flight and hotel bookings, but in a new way, fine-tuned for the venue industry. Just like Steve Jobs applied touch screen technology (that existed for decades) to the mobile phone industry. He did not invent anything and was not even first, but he did it right and it was a big market shift.

ÿ

It will be a super simple to use and to understand site, accessible at this address http://venue.today.


	Open Venue.Today
	
	
	Enter Location, Date and Venue Sizeÿand press Search(other search parameters could be added later or hidden behind ""advanced search"")
	
	
	Receiveÿa list of venues that match criteria together with real-time availability information and price
	
	
	View venue profiles with images and descriptions and choose the most suitable one
	
	
	Press Book and pay online with a credit card for instant confirmation E-mail.

	ÿ

	Process should take between 5 and 15 minutes and free the client from annoying calling, writing and waiting.
	
ÿ

!ÿExtra use case for event managers:


	Event managers are potential ""super users"" of Venue.Today, because they need to book venues all the time.
	
	
	Almost every medium and large size company is an event manager as they often have permanent event organizing staff.
	
	
	Such users could have access to ""premium"" functionality to submit request to all venues that match defined criteria at once:

	
		Event manager submits request, explaining venueÿsize, other parameters and filling description fieldÿabout other special custom needs such as catering, strong WIFI etc.
		
		
		All venues that match criteria automatically receive notification about the request and have possibility to answer it with their best offer.
		
		
		Event manager chooses best offer and makes booking, saving a lot of time and getting a better deal.
		
	
ÿ

Competitors

ÿ

After extensive research and analysis of competition, a number of potentially competing platforms were identified:


	CVENT.com ? big US business, develops meeting management system and runs DB of venues.
	
	
	ThatVenue.com ? Malaysian startup, limited geographically, nice design.
	
	
	Konferencem.lv ? Latvian startup, limited geographically (Baltics).
	
	
	VenueFinder.com ?ÿUKbusiness, sophisticated venue database.
	
	
	Some others...
	
ÿ

However, not a single one of discovered competing platforms has real-time functionality which is the main concept of my proposed solution.

In other words, neither of discovered competitors is solving the described problem.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Expensive guidebooks, audioguides or overly simplistic apps are not adding much value to the visit that often simply bore people. The Large part of the population for various reasons (social, economic, health) can?t travel to the physical location.

ÿ

We want to develop a mobile app where we can witness the story of the visited place in 3D as geolocated, interactive 3D scene supported by augmented reality and image identification. Scenes will be matched by geolocation to current surroundings for the on-site visitors. Imagine pointing your tablet at the ruin and seeing the living castle in full glory. User will see reenacted, living enviroment with bustling cities, people on streets, famous characters guiding visitors and interactive, gamified tasks to complete and learn by play.

Scenes planned at 18 European Locations have the potential of reaching 127,5 mln physical visitors travelling there every year. (Scenes include: Collosseum, Notre Dame, Sacre Coeur, London Tower etc.) According to UNESCO, cultural and natural heritage tourism is ?the most rapidly growing international sector of the tourism industry?. OECD and UNWTO reports that cultural tourism accounts for 40% of all international tourism worldwide.

1st to market -ÿThere?s no app featuring reenactments of events and people
	Strong partnerships -ÿPartner museums and users receive share in profits and development for free.
	Quality -ÿOur scenes are designed to show AAA game quality
	Gamification -ÿComplete quests and achievements and share with friends
	Adoption potential - travelling tourists, virtual tourists, multiplatform

We face following risks:

Competing solutions - Fast implementation and time to reach the market is the key to secure a safe position.
	Pitching Heritage sites - In our model heritage site operator gets scene development for free and his share of income from each download of his scene.
	Indifference of mobile users - Pastguide will tackle this barrier by relying on heritage site partnerships during the first 5 years.",Tech provider,X,0,0,X,0,0,,Software,Authoring and Publishing Software,Applications,Content Applications,1,0,http://www.pastguide.com,0,50000,pastguide.com

The business idea is to build a web site for developing, sharing, shopping and ordering of tactile maps for the visually impaired people. The competition in the market is based on old technology while Versoteq?s service will take into use modern web tools and 3D printing. In addition we will connect the customers with the providers of the maps (3D developers and tactile map specialists) efficiently from around the world. The solution advantages: 1) The customers will get the maps for a fair price compared to traditional maps, 2) site community and Versoteq?s specialists will guarantee that the map quality on the site is high and takes blind?s special requirements into account, 3) 3D designers will get freelancer work, or even small companies may specialice in providing such maps to the site, 4) the quality and processes already been developed by Versoteq will be adopted widely and rapidly and will help to improve the quality of life of the visually impaired.

ÿ

The business idea

The income to Versoteq comes from brokering the design assignments and mandatory quality consultation (10% of the trade) and brokering finished tactile maps from the site library (5? fixed price per map). The details of the projected turnover and income are in the atteched plan. The business is first launched inside Europe but nothing prevents from spreading the site service throughout the world.

ÿ

In the future the site operations can be used also for creating maps for people with normal vision, for advertising or normal guiding uses. In the beginning, the target audience is selected so that the market is niche (little or no competition), market need exists and it is clear how the marketing and sales will begin.

In addition, the library also includes the necessary data for the virtual museum 3D scenes. The scenes will be created and shown in fron-end devices (for virtual museum visitors) using the 3D-UI-3DXML generic enabler.

ÿ

Usage of described service will have several benefits: 1) museum visitors may use virtual museum services to get a realistic museum visit experience, 2) museums can have visitors (free or charged) from around the world instead of having only visitors who have the possibility to travel there, 3) the museum artifacts are digitally stored, 4) in the future anyone can use the interfaces and guidelines for setting up the virtual museum in the service (this is not part of the project but will be developed in the future) ? ultimately this creates jobs and spreads European cultural heritage cost-efficiently through the internet.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

164,CREA164,CREA,CREAtiFi,Finland,Scoopinion Oy,FindMushroom - App for tourists and locals to easily find mushrooms via open map and weather data,"It„inen Teatterikuja 5, A12, 00100 Helsinki, Finland",Consumer other,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Johannes Koponen,"FindMushrooms helps tourists and local tourists to find mushrooms easily, using publicly available open data and weather information to count probable mushroom growing spots. The competitive advantage comes from the learning algorithm that crunches large amounts of location specific weather data and open data about forest types and forest shadows (hills, forest density).

ÿ

Customers

43% of Finns collect mushrooms each autumn (Finnish Forest Institute,ÿSource in Finnish). FindMushroom app is meant for the least experienced mushroom collectors, but it can be used even by the professionals. The spearhead user is a urban dweller who would like to spend a day out in the nearby forests but is unsure where to go.

ÿ

Value Proposition

FindMushrooms promises that the users won?t come back home empty handed. By improving accessibility, convenience and reducing risks it makes a good sense for people to download the free app and rent the nearby mushroom location information from the service.

ÿ

Customer relationship

Customer feedback is used to optimize the learning algorithm that combines the used datasets.

ÿ

Channels

Awareness

Service is advertised in mushroom picking hotspots, i.e. parking slots and public transportation stops that are near known mushroom picking places, such as Palohein„ and Nuuksio. Likewise, the service is mentioned in relevant online communities. With the service, people are also able to share their mushroom picking spots, further increasing the awareness of the product.

ÿ

Evaluation of the value proposition

The app is free and the most mushroom location information is sold via in-app purchases. Thus, users are able to get to know the app before they purchase the information.

ÿ

Renting the mushroom location database

Mushroom location information is updated constantly due to known growing periods, rain information and lighting information (based on landscape shadows, clouds and forest density). Thus, the mushroom location information deprecates rather fast. This is why it makes sense to sell information snapshots via easy in-app purchases.

ÿ

After sales

It is possible to advertise new locations and good times to go to collect mushrooms via push notifications.

ÿ

Key activities and key resources

Key activity is establishing a solid foundation for the algorithm that collects relevant open data and confirms and disregards findings based on user feedback. This key activity provides a competitive advantage: this intellectual capital is the key resource. The intellectual capital includes ever-increasing knowledge on spatio-temporal mushroom locations and constantly improving algorithm in guessing the correct locations. This is very difficult to copy. Installed free apps provide customer contact channel that can be used to encourage users to collect mushroom in the following autumn as well.

ÿ

Key partners

Key partners include the providers of open data, especially National Land Survey of Finland (growing spot information and shadow information), Finnish Meteorological Institute and Finnish Food safety authority Evira (mushroom information). ÿÿÿ

ÿ

Cost structure

Cost structure in FindMushrooms is based on (somewhat) fixed costs that include platform maintenance and customer feedback costs and variable costs including server maintenance, data handling and calculations, research and development costs and, most importantly, advertisement costs.

ÿ

Revenue streams

Revenue streams in FindMushrooms are based on providing temporal access to mushroom location database. This means it is volume dependent fixed pricing. If the service becomes very successful in certain key areas, it is possible to change to yield management based pricing, as mushrooms are eventually a limited resource",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Those values do determine the financial growth and situation of a company, however the problem with this view in today?s world is that the economy is more and more reliant on the knowhow, relationships and people themselves as an asset. This is especially true in the creative industry. These kind of soft values are intangible and hard to measure. Everyone knows that people who feel happy are more likely to put more effort into their work than people who feel down. Similarly, fast-paced work can cause both positive and negative stress, depending on how much satisfaction people get out of their work.

ÿ

Doing collects data on the wellbeing and satisfaction of employees and empowers companies and institutes to use this as a tool of overall performance measurement. Doing is an app that allows people to anonymously indicate their mood and well-being on a daily basis. The app is based on ease of interaction and a combination of factors that, in our view, are the causes of both professional satisfaction and dissatisfaction. To summarize, Doing is using quantified self to improve one?s professional productivity.

ÿ

We believe our solution, Doing, can completely transform the way creative people, teams and companies can be measured and lead by collecting and analyzing softer and bigger data than typical money/time based metrics can offer to companies.

ÿ

Target market

Doing brings a tool for measuring employee wellbeing and performance tracking for creative industries. Creativity is hard to measure and even harder to put a price on. By the data and analytics that will be developed with Doing, the companies can foresee their productivity and estimate and increase employee satisfaction. The institution view shows the data anonymously without the company being able to track individuals, but rather the overall mood of a crowd.

ÿ

Doing will be developed from the start with an international mindset and our goal is to launch our beta App with at least one international partner in August 2015.

ÿ

Competitors

At the moment similar analytics are done through collecting customer satisfaction on-site (http://www.happy-or-not.com/). However, just by pressing a smiley -icon doesn?t tell you much deeper analytics or a person?s satisfaction. A smiley can indicate different things to different people and doesn?t tell us the reasons behind the mood. Overall moods of people are being analysed through Twitter texts and are illustrated through wider data analysis (http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/tracking-u-s-mood-through-twitter/). This can be useful in wider context and when measuring a distinct group of people that are in the reach of and using social media.

ÿ

But when you are targeting a group of individuals from various backgrounds and searching for tools for employee satisfaction, no easy solution exists. Doing aims to this niche in the creative industry by bringing a tool to collect and monitor data on the factors that influence people?s wellbeing at work.

ÿ

Business Model

The goal is first to examine what benefits creative companies can get out of their employees wellbeing data and how these can be connected with the overall performance of a company. Secondly our goal is to verify the business model. We believe that for individual users, Doing should be free. We believe that ultimately the businesses will be willing to pay on the use of the data that Doing collects as it will bring direct savings for them through improved employee satisfaction.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

ÿ

Our aim is to create community of modern architecture, a platform for education and marketplace.

TellAbout ArtWork is a cloud-based service and application for creative people who make physical art, handicrafts or collector items for sale. The solution enables them to increase the value and appreciation of the crafted item by providing means to accumulate its uniqueness by capturing information about its creation process, the quality of work and making this information available to buyers and audience.

The accumulation of the uniqueness can then be continued during the later phases of item?s lifetime by adding history and background from exhibitions, ownerships, usage and reviews of the item. ÿ

The information is collected and stored to a rich digital story album that stays as a digital part of the physical item.

ÿ

Target audience

TellAbout ArtWork can be used by artists and craftsmen of various fields. The solution is used also by buyers, sellers, agents, galleries, exhibition organizers and public audience related to the piece. The solution suits for global market and can be scaled fast when product/market fit is found. The solution can be fine-tuned to different market segments of handicrafts and creative industries. At the low end this can be a mass-market product for hobbyists.

ÿ

Solution in more detail

The story album allows artists and handicrafters to very easily and without any special skills to tell about the creating of their physical art piece, handicraft or unique collector item during the creation process.

ÿ

The telling can be done with whatever device (mobile, tablet, pc) artist feels most confident and without any need to understand any web technology. They can just add a story to the story album dedicated for the item. Artist does not need to concentrate on the looks, or formatting of the content she or he inputs, just capture when she or he wants to do it.

ÿ

Confidence is increased with the fact that story albums are not published on the web as such immediately, but are private and artist can keep it as a journal of the creation process. ÿThe sketches, source of inspirations, materials, work methods, flow of the work, interesting details can be included in the form (video, audio, text, pictures) that artist wishes.

ÿ

The album can have invited members who can collaborate, so artist can invite his representative e.g., art dealer or gallery for comments or for to add list of exhibitions the piece has visited. In case of ordered handicraft, the existing customer can see how the piece is being constructed and communicate on the details.

ÿ

Album is private until owner decides to open it. Typically this would be wanted for exhibitions, and when put for sale. ÿSo artist can publish the album and give a link to the album for the audience to view it. The link can be attached to the item. Album is viewable with all devices. Album can also be printed to a physical booklet if so wished for.

ÿ

The story album follows the physical piece, so the ownership of the album is forwarded to the each new owner. ÿThe previous owners and artist stay by default as members of the album if they want to and the new owner does not deny. The nice thing about this is that this way the artist stays in contact with her/his piece and its current owners and new stories possibly added to the piece.

Benefits for artist

+ Get more interest towards the piece (media, public)

+ Helps audience to enjoy the piece and appreciate it

+ Get better price for the piece that has unique history

+ No need to learn new skills, no need to change creative process

+ Collaboration where artist is in control: can use common story album for having dialog with customers, sellers, audience, if wants to.

+ History, previous and current owners known and accessible for artist also after sales",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

More and more people could afford tourism outside of their home region. The top tourist destinations, e.g., Rome, Paris, London, see increase of tourist inflow from all around the world, especially from Asia. An interesting new trend identified by some recent tourist reviews, e.g., review done in the countries of ex-USSR, illustrating that after visiting major attractions most of tourists want to see local regional specifics. However, unlike most well known tourist spots, majority of regional destinations are almost unknown to public. This creates demand for new ways of promoting not so well known tourist destinations, and for this task it is especially critical to deliver tourist information in most clear and attractive form.

The last two years of cooperation with museums and regional tourist offices convinced us that there is huge market potential. We already received some support via regional programs, e.g., ENPI CBC Karelia, as well as get direct contracts from local museums. We see clear interest in discussed type of solution in many regions, and we are targeting to create mass-market tourism platform, which will specifically address needs and specifics of regional tourism. For example, instead of making tourism offer around a single ?world-top attraction?, we have to deal with a series of attractions, museums and points of interests, which are grouped according to multiple parameters to best meet personal preferences of the tourist. The developed solution is open source platform and we positioning ourselves as a service company. Regional tourist centers and museums already now are ready to give us small contracts on design of some specific functions and modules for the system. The second source of income is B2C sales. One of our services is a client for accessing museum content (including audio guide functionality) and it has been preliminary discussed already with two museums that they could allow (and even recommend) direct sale of this service to visitors, as long as the price will be affordable (currently it is discussed on the level of 0.3-1.0 EUR for the service). Also we are discussing idea of adding function for purchasing museum and excursion tickets online via our service and then we can keep some commission.

All these ideas are still under development and this is why we apply for this project ? to support our development. Moreover, we are planning to enhance our solution by the new tool for promoting regions and for this purpose we see huge potential of 3D Internet and realXtend platform. We already discussed with one regional tourist office and they would be interested to create 3D Internet models of most attractive places and install 3D Internet demo booth in partner tourist offices in other regions, as well as promote it via Internet and network of hotel chains that have special deals in the region. We see great potential in combining Geo2Tag and realXtend platform and have potential customers interested to order solutions based on this combination.ÿOur competitiveness is based on the new business model that was created specifically to take into account specifics of the target market, and on existing of ready solutions, which are already used by 12 museums (Open Karelia network) and deals with a few museums are in pipeline.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

The same software platform can be applied to both contexts with only slight alterations that can be done with built in settings (editable by the customer company). Viima's software allows the end users to collaborate in a visual, social and fun user interface that has already been validated with production customers.

ÿ

When Viima's software is used in the context of the company's customers, the most common use case is collecting feedback. For instance a B2C clothing company could ask consumers how they perceive the current line of jeans and what modifications or improvement suggestions do they have. The customers can then transparently voice their opinions by inputting so called ""suggestions"" to Viima's software. They can also like or comment on suggestions inputted by other users. The software works as a communication channel between the company and the customers so the company can also take part in the discussions. The phenominal effect that Viima's tool provides is that it makes feedback collections or other such customer facing questionnaires transparent to all stakeholders and it automatically pinpoints the most significant content that the customers have inputted. These have been validated ÿwith production customers to not only increase customer satisfaction, but also generate new additions to the company's line of offering. The latter part also has an already evaluated market potential since the customers who wanted the particular product or service are known in advance.

ÿ

When using Viima's software in the context of the companys employees, the most common cases are internal ideation or innovation processes. Here Viima allows for different people from all around the company's value chain to come together, share insights and come up with innovations. The innovations based on Viima's experience with using the software for internal ideation use can be small changes to everyday working routines or even new radical product ideas. Often times these great ideas that can be born by connecting people from different backgrounds either don't ever get born or are discussed over coffee breaks, but then forgotten as they don't get documented. With Viima, all of the content is documented and structured so that no brilliant idea gets lost.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

We aim for the broadest possible market and we will only use technologies that are available to the majority of mobile device users.ÿ

ÿ

We have already developed our first game, Hidden Heroes, that is now in soft launch. The game is based on barcode and QR code scanning: Players scan products, receive a land and fight for the ownership of the products. This first game has validated our platform, and helps us to start understanding player behaviour in the real world. The product is primarily aimed at 13-39 year old male audience and the game sessions range from around a minute to tens of minutes. We want to broaden the audience and aim for much shorter game sessions and a more broad audience.

ÿ

In the CreatiFI project we want to develop PetSpot, our next game in planning, that is aimed at everyone aged 9 and up. It is a no barrier to entry Mixed Reality game where the goal of the game is for the real world to adapt the game experience to the player and not requiring the player to do anything.

ÿ

Current mobile games answer the basic consumer need to be entertained in the short moments they have available. Mobile games have done a fantastic job in this, but bringing the real world elements to games has not yet taken off. The main reason is the barrier to entry they impose as for example Ingress, the location based game, requires the players to physically go to a location to complete tasks. This is a serious barrier to entry for the players, as the cannot really be picked up anywhere.

ÿ

We are creating a unique new product, that does not impose any new barriers to entry. Pet Spot is a simple game of collecting animals from the real world. The game is a mixed reality game, where players can at any point try to spot and catch animals from a fantasy world that is overlapping with ours. The game works as follows (subject to further prototyping next year):

1. As players start the game, the game checks what animals roam around this location. There are always the same animals roaming at the same location, so if a player wants to catch a special animal and knows where it has been seen, it is always there. This will allow the game to have viral effects as well - i.e. tell friends that at the Piccadilly Circus there is a lion roaming!

2. Players may try to catch an animal with ?the catcher? and they are always awarded with a new animal. Players get the animals based on rarity, so a rarer animal is caught less often.

3. With the animals, players can engage in fun activities, that will be protyped in the first phase of the project and further defined throughout the lifetime of the product.

ÿ

The product is a mobile game that is made available in application store(s), and a game service running the game world. The product offers true differentiation and innovation in an era where most mobile games fiercely copy each other!

ÿ

The core business of PetSpot is two fold.

First, the game is a free to play game that is aimed at a wide target audience. We want to entertain players where ever they are and always offer an interesting snack of a game!

Second, the interaction with the real world offers a very large opportunity to tie in the brands and advertisement in a totally new way. To make this effective, we need to first gather a large number of players into the game.",Tech provider,,0,0,X,0,0,,Software,Authoring and Publishing Software,Applications,Content Applications,"1, and 2",0,http://www.lumegames.com,0,0,lumegames.com

The product is a mobile application, which allows people to create and use different routes created by the community. Routes can range from a group of friends sharing a path they wish to take on their trek, all the way to companies and charities wishing to provide treasure hunt experiences for their participants. There are also plans to integrate this as part of tourism services, guiding people through different sights or interesting shopping locations. Even utilizing the application in geo caching is an option.

ÿ

User guidance is designed to be extensible with few different models supported. Two that are planned for prototype are the basic map-based guidance, and a modification based on the current version of Finnay?s Wayfinder. Map-based guidance would show your basic map view, telling you the distance and showing the location of your next waypoint. Creator can choose whether the entire route is shown immediately, or a single waypoint at a time. Wayfinders compass shows a graphical view of the direction you should take, and the distance from the target. This encompasses some gamified elements, and thus is more suitable for a treasure hunt / geo caching scenarios.

ÿ

User can browse through a list of created routes. These can be user-made content, or sponsored routes created by different companies. These are distinguished in the browsing phase. After finding a route they find interesting, they are able to add them to their own collection. This makes it easier to bookmark them for later use.

Users are able to create their own groups, with which to share private routes that are not available to public.

Along the chosen routes, application can highlight different Points Of Interest that have been entered into the system. They can be different sightseeing locations, or partner companies that have paid for visibility.

ÿ

Route creation is done by swiping through the map view, and tapping to add a waypoint. A single route can have 1-n waypoints, in addition to the starting location. Waypoint can have different functionality bound to them. You can add a custom message, activate the next waypoint etc.

ÿ

Pleathub mission

Our mission is to disrupt the ways that textile print designs are being sold and bought. The goal is that Pleathub does to the textile print industry what a marketplace like 99designs.com did for the graphic design industry.ÿ

ÿ

A textile design marketplace

Pleathub will operate the marketplace and act as the central piece between the sellers and the buyers. As marketplace operator our main role is to build and maintain the liquidity of the marketplace (ie having a healthy balance of supply and demand).

ÿ

B2B

Pleathub is not a C2C and ""open marketplace"" in the sense of for example eBay. Pleathub is a B2B marketplace connecting professional textile graphic designers with fashion retail companies (like Desigual, Primark, H&amp;M, Zara etc).ÿThe goal is to create a modern two sided niche marketplace where we as operators tightly control the experience. From payment, customer support, inventory management, item curation, payment processing to legal issues. We see Pleathub as operating as a ""full stack operator"".

ÿ

The quality and simplicity of the user experience, of the support and of the buying process will be at the heart of the Pleathub. In order to remove as much friction as possible in the user experience, background checks etc of both designers and buyers will be done by Pleathub.

ÿ

Business model for the marketplace
Pleathub will on the behalf of the designers sell licenses to their designs:
ÿ

Licensed stock design (the prints can be used a limited amount of time)
	Licensed extended stock designs (the prints can be used unlimited amount of time)
	Licensed premium designs (the prints have a one-off exclusive license and can only be bought once)

Option 1 and 2 will be open to all while option three will be Premium access where membership will be background checked by Pleathub. Designs sold in the premium area will be more expensive and we expect the majority of the revenue will take place there.

Revenue model for Pleathub

The revenue model is percentage based and membership based:
ÿ

Pleathub takes a percentage on each sale
	Pleathub charges ""VIP"" buyers a monthly fee for access to premium textile design patternsÿ

People don't always know even their very own neighborhood and exploring your surroundings is easily forgotten.

ÿ

Currently museums have extensive exhibitions with a large quantity of information of variety of different artefacts. The information is not personalized taking into account the visitors interests and needs. Many times this leads to exhausting experience for the visitors; it is difficult to digest all the information and sometimes it is irrelevant or impossible to understand (if you are not familiar with the context). Another problem the visitor is faced with is how to spend the time wisely - where is the information that interests him or her the most.ÿ

ÿ

The idea is to provide a fully funtional indoor navigation system for museums based on iBeacons technology. The iBeacon technology is a low-cost and low-powered and easy to deploy solution for museums to solve the problem of custom guided tours and artefact information.ÿ

ÿ

In the long term the aim is to provide a personalised museum exprience for visitors that not only includes the exhibition experience but also all the services (restaurant, cafes, interactive games and quizzes etc) that a museum can offer, including the payment for these services (Apple Pay?).

ÿ

Furthermore, museums as public institutions have also a specific responsibility of making their exhibitions accessible and to enable all citizens, regardles of disabilities, to take part in their history and cultural heritage. Thus the application we wish to develop within the project will comply to the highest accessibility standards. This will be ensured with the iterative development process with rigorous user-testing of the application based on the methods developed by Funka Nu AB (market leader in accessibility in the Nordics) and with the cooperation of the Gothenburg Natural History Museum (Sweden) providing the test-bed / living lab environment. ÿ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

The majority of homecare customers are not able to leave their home without assistance. For this reason they have little or no chance to attend cultural activities. We intend to bring these services to their own homes. Our business idea is to provide interactive, innovative and versatile cultural services to home-dwelling elderly with poor functional capacity. Our services will be co-created together with the end-users to better meet their true cultural needs and wishes.

ÿ

In addition to the integration of the cultural services, the project includes a special focus on developing an interface that will be comfortable for elderly with only a little, if any, experience with modern technology.

ÿ

A wide range of creative industry professionals (e.g. musicians, dancers, circus and theatre professionals) is also participating in the service design.

ÿ

The nature of cultural services can be versatile (e.g. karaoke, citing poems, worship sessions, guiding through art exhibition) and they will be produced by professionals. The cultural services can be transferred to the end-users either online or as recordings with a volunteer supplying the interactive group discussions. According to our preliminary survey, numerous professional artists are willing to present their work with a symbolic fee - or even free of charge, at least during the test use - for an audience of elderly citizens.

ÿ

The technology brought to the home of the elderly is an easy-to-use touch screen with a microphone, camera and video connection. We will not develop the technology as it is already available. For us the technology is only a platform to integrate our services.

ÿ

In developing our services we are making the use of the following FIWARE enablers: Object Storage and BigData Analysis.

ÿ

The business idea will be executed by our experienced professional team with excellent skills and vast professional networks. It has over 80 years of combined experience in user-driven service design, science, technology and business.

ÿ

Our competitive edge derives partly from the design of easy-to-use services suitable for elderly people and from the efficient and professional production of services through the management of a large network of professionals. To be able to scale our service production we intend to utilize an open-source based tool, which enables us to recruit, schedule and manage our large network of artists and volunteers.

ÿ

Our main competitors are other evolving organizations providing virtual arts. The present providers are mainly web-based and their services are not targeted to the elderly with significantly declined functional capacity. ÿThe present user-interfaces are also far too complex and unattractive for this target group.

ÿ

Numerous studies are published showing the positive effects of arts and culture to a variety of health-related outcomes. Even an association with up to three years longer life span has been found. In addition to its recreational effects, participation and involvement in cultural events promotes health, social inclusion and networks.

ÿ

The creative industry benefits from our product being able to reach an audience otherwise unreachable.

ÿ

Our business idea is to meet the need for novel strategies for delivering new services for elderly care. The demand is growing due to the rapidly aging population and the simultaneous lack of financial and human resources. There is also a growing necessity to decrease the expensive institutionalized care and convert it to homecare, even for those who are increasingly frail and suffering from immobility, loneliness, fear, and isolation. To cope at home they need novel easy-to-use services delivered to their home.",Service provider,,0,0,0,X,0,,Hardware,0,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,0,0,0

Launzer.com is #1 Marketplace for branded and 3D pprinted merchandise. Company behind the service - 3D Online Factory Ltd - was established in laten 2013 by serial entrepreneur and TV&amp;Media veterian Kari Voutila to solve the problem of merchandise: Too many gate keepers and and too slow reaction for what's happening in the markets.

Launzer is build for brands and their core fans. The idea is provide fast, safe and profitable channel for brands to make merchandise and build up engagement with their fans. For fans Launzer is the place to show their commitment for their favourite brands and get new kind of immediate customer experience with 3D Printing. The focus is in Gaming and in Entertainment.

Launzer is not a 3D Printing service. There are two ways to get the merchandise: Downloading the file and printing it with consumers' own devices or using printing services. The main business line is to get merchandise through i.materialise - the world's largest industrial 3D printing service - to which Launzer full integration.

Launzer's beta version was released in November 2014 at launzer.com. Untill now 30 brands are signed to use Launzer as their new merchandise channel, whichÿcome in step by step. The target is to crease the mount of brands up to 100 by end of 2015.

ÿ

The Idea: Play &amp; Launz - experience

In the digital world consumers want to express their feelings and actions immediately. One of the ways to show this is to buy different kind of merchandise around the brand to which consumers have strong emotionals relatoins. Specially this goes with Gaming and Entertainment.

Idea is to create an API for mobile and browser games which allows players to ÿpurchase objects inside the games while their are playing, without leaving the game just pushing the ""Launz"" buttom. In the first API (which is to be funded through Creati FI) there are ready objects (databases) inside the games and accordingly in Launzer.com. The printing can take place in several printing services or with player's own device if the brand owner allows that.

The API offers first to 3D Online Facoty/Launzer a remarkable competition advantage in the field of 3D Printed e-commerce services and is the main focus in company's development map for 2015.

For Gaming Brands the API offers a totally new way to make digital merhcandise with better profits and gives additional value to build up better and stronger engagement with their players. API can be used also as a reward, e.g. players get chance to get free/or with payment different kind of merchandise after their have reached certain level of the game.

For Players API offers a totally new experience inside the gaming and gives them immediate consumer experince and a possibility to engage with their favourite brands.

The road map for the project is planned that API would be available in Q3/2015.

ÿ

The possible beta partners for development would be at the moment:

Legendary Games, browser based (UK)

Behaviour Interactive, Android &amp; IOS (Can)

ÿ

The next step after Play&amp;Launz epxperience to continue the development with co-creation and modification tools for players which allows to them create their own e.g. figurines inside the the game and then ""Launz"" them into the real world. The target for the second step is to get that API out live in Q1/2016.

Pondering on smart cities - we argue rural or remote places must become smart too. But the smartness of a rural place is very different form the urban one. We are great defenders of the rural quality of life and we are convinced that technology can contribute to making rural life extremely rewarding in 21st century.


With our arts program we have proven that we can be highly innovative and can compete with urban institutions like a Contemporary Arts Museums in a capital of a country. We are saying that remoteness is an advantage and holds so much unexplored potential to grow, which we don?t even know yet.


For example: What happens when we connect all food producers in an area and make it visible to locals and visitors. What happens if we synch the ferry schedules with peoples smart phones to signal what ferry one is taking? What happens when we list and categorize all local businesses? What happens when we show all the horses that live on the island? We are thinking of visualizing property in colors, show accommodations for tourism, implement a high quality hiking map? We suggest hiking routes which include historical visiting points, where we explain special places and its stories. Hailuoto is a migration point for birds, we collaborate with the local bird association and implement a Hailuoto bird map. Many subjects can be looked at and considered for its potential on smart phones: Farming, foresting, ship harbors, fishing, recreation, history, education etc.


By programming and designing an App for this island we see a huge potential not only for tourism but also for inspiration, development and well being for locals.


To be able to hold all info of the island Hailuoto in one hand could improve the accessibility and the experience for visitors and offer locals more sufficiency and visibility.


Important is that we know Hailuoto very well and we employ artists and designers to realize our visions excellently. We will collaborate with everybody represented on a personal level and face to face and interview all businesses and officials of the island. We use open source methods to realize the app and work 100% inclusive.


We are thinking represent of all generations, children as well as elderly in our advisory team to listen to their point of views and ideas too. Every idea implemented must hold an improvement in practicality and usefulness to the traditional way-of-doing-things.


Involving many layers of the islands reality and society like list services, create a business network, show interconnectivity, visualize history, provide extensive and very mature nature information, implement arts &amp; culture, provide open source for input of citizens and visitors, resolve infrastructure improvements and more, we only begin to understand the potential of such an interface in a rural place.


The app will tell about the place how it really is and it will also tell about the past, future and fiction in an intriguing way. It will deliver high value content practically and culturally. By involving our artists and creatives it will include progressive technological skills of visualization, sonification and interactive story telling. And will provide improvement for locals, visitors and tourists.


The idea is in the beginning, we have to develop the exact way to realize the App technically and also how to maintain and update it in the future frequently, which is a natural consequence of such an app. We must develop a concrete business model for the launch and after the launch. There is no competitors to our knowledge. We will use consultation and outsource to third parties in areas we lack expertise.

You can look for a place to stay, a desk to work at or just arrange a meet up for coffee. Startuptravels is also a platform where the entire entrepreneurial landscape is mapped for you based on geographical location. You can find co-working spaces, accelerators or in the city you are traveling to but also search for entrepreneurs with specific skills you are looking for.

ÿ

What makes Startuptravels new and exciting is that the purpose of the platform is to find new contacts based on geographical location. The conversation starts because one person is visiting another country and wants to connect with a likeminded person.

ÿ

Users can find entrepreneurs based on their geographical location and are capable of reaching out to them even though they have no previous connection.

ÿ

Most entrepreneurs today resort to LinkedIn, Facebook or their personal network when they want to find local entrepreneurs to meet while traveling. However, LinkedIn and Facebook are not made for reaching out to new people to meet - it is made for networking and interaction with current contacts. Both Facebook and LinkedIn try to limit the ""approach behavior"" by using paid InMails and the ""Other"" folder.

ÿ

On Startuptravels it is legitimate behavior to reach out to other people for the sake of reaching out and arrange a meet-up, which is behavior we have seen to a great extent already on the platform.

ÿ

This way we can interconnect the world of entrepreneurs!

SP.K.,My House 3D - collaborative online 3D tool for interior designers and their clients,"Puˆawska 257, 4, 02769 Warsaw, Poland",BUSINESS SERVICES,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Tomasz Kucharski,"My House 3D is a virtual space that brings together interior designers and clients in the form of an interactive website designed to ease the strenuous process of designing or re-designing a space in one?s home.

ÿ

Our company will use a commission-based business model, which will generate a fee from a transaction between the interior designer and the client, facilitated by our website. We chose this model because the website, acting as the agent, is an intrinsic part of the sales process ? it is a business model designed for close cooperation. The fee will be charged to the client if they wish to access the data of the designer in case of a portfolio search, and to the designer if the designer wished to respond to an advertisement posted by a prospective client.

ÿ

The website will feature online portfolios from interior designers, giving them a virtual space in which they can showcase their work and style, allowing new potential customers to see their work. The site will allow clients to browse our database of designer portfolios, based on keywords and tags, allowing them to find exactly what they are after in their design project. Prospective clients can then contact the designer through the website and collaborate online in our 3D studio.

ÿ

We will also incorporate a home repair space ÿwhere consumers can find home-improvement experts, and an online store, where consumers may purchase selected pieces for their home and incorporate them into the designs of the interior designers.

ÿ

The website will also allow users to post advertisements about upcoming design projects, which allows designers to submit bids for each project in the form of an online form. The client can then select the designer they like and contact them through the website.

ÿ

As mentioned above, we will create an online 3D studio, based on FiWare technology, which will allow the designer to showcase their work on each project to their clients, and allow the client to provide valuable input into the development of the design idea.

ÿ

Thus the website will greatly contribute to the optimization of workflows in the design process and allow clients to find the perfect designer by either posting an ad or browsing our database of online portfolios.

201,CREA201,CREA,CREAtiFi,Finland,Motere Oy,CogFut ? Learning Cognitive Football Skills,"Puutarhatie 9 A as 2, 02710 Espoo, Finland","ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND RECREATION, Consumer health/wellness",0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Jari  Takatalo,"CogFut is a browser-based digital edugame that teaches basics about football and develops players? perceptual-cognitive skills. CogFut is designed to combine young athletes (7-15 years) entertainment video gaming and their sport. In addition, CogFut provides a tool for team coaches to teach their players football tactics and new concepts in a digital environment that is familiar for the players. Coaches can present new drills through CogFut prior to physical practices (i.e., flipped class room), follow player?s performance and virtual practices (pinpoint difficulties and motivation), evaluate their player?s baseline in their cognitive functioning, for example, and follow player?s overall progression during the season. As a social platform, CogFut provides players means to communicate with each others in addition to their coaches.

ÿ

The first step is to develop an edutainment version of the CogFut. The annual world-wide edutainment market-size is more than $9 billion (2012). The market for an edugame like CogFut is huge. There are approximately 1,000 registered football clubs in Finland and thousands more in Europe (e.g., England 40,000, Germany26,000, France 18,200) and world-wide. Possible revenue stream in Finland could be following: in boy?s age-group born in 2007 (7-years-old) there are approximately 60 players in the biggest teams, which gives an average of about 20 players per club nation-wide. Approximately 800 clubs have 07 boy?s team, which makes a total of 16,000 players. If 40% of these players purchase a 10? yearly CogFut licence, the cash flow would be approximately 64,000?. With a CogFut licence a player can create a user-account that records all the achievements, play the game, and is eligible for new levels that are introduced during the year (the number of these is not yet decided). Parents would surely prefer CogFut over an entertainment game.

ÿ

The above example describes cash-flow only in one boy?s age-group in Finland. Such potential cash-flow would enable developing new levels for the game and to market it around the world. Additionally cash-flow could be attained from girl players, coach/club licences (possibility to get a company sponsorships for a club or an individual team), and other age-groups (8-15 years). Not to forget that a new player generation starts playing football every year.

ÿ

The future vision of CogFut is that the fundamental game mechanics are utilized to develop similar edutainment games for different sports, such as ice-hockey and basketball. In addition, the edutainment version provides CogFut team valuable data that shows the re-play value of each level and enables us to predicting the longevity of play in each level produced. The hottest levels are then combined into an entertainment CogFut, namely FunFut. In this point, different versions for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) will be developed and distributed through application market places such as AppStore. Again, markets for such a product do exist in the form of hundreds of millions of people interested in football around the world.

ÿ

In the current CreatiFI application the focus is on developing the prototype of the football edugame version of the CogFut.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Spaceitup is the first Space-sharing platform in the world that allows anybody to personalize locations and share them with others. Spaceitup is an innovative way of combining maps, location interests and communications.

ÿ

Mobile app

Spaceitup provides a mobile app to Space up anything people do and share it with others. Follow these three simple steps to create your first Space:

ÿ


	Create a Space - a Space consist of a name, location and size, the size can be anything from your backyard to the Amazon rainforest.
	
	
	Spice it up - spice up your Space with location based information, i.e. where the parking area is or where it is safe to swim, show nearby POIs (FI-Ware POI Data Provider). The cooler your Space the more people will use it.
	
	
	Share it - once you have created a Space it is time to share it with others. Similar to Youtube movie you can share your Space with everybody, your friends or keep it private.
	
ÿ

Once a Space is shared, it may be used by people simultaneously. People using the same Space can chat and see each others location and use the information stored inside that Space. With the mobile app you can create as many Spaces you like or find and use Spaces made by others.

ÿ

What makes it special

Spaces are personal, they reflect actual values and interests of what people do at a certain location, Spaces are more accurate than traditional mobile maps that are often advertising driven. Spaceitup is a new generation of location services, based on the principles of openness, usability and collaboration.

ÿ

Tourism

Spaceitup is the perfect solution for companies providing tourist services. Providing campsite locations, showing touristic tour routes and contacting people have never been easier.

ÿ

Because tourism is all about locations and with Spaceitup - locations with their relevant information are always available at your fingertips, even abroad. However the range of applications are nearly unlimited. The Spaceitup platform can be used by local communities, businesses and NGOs to provide location information and communicate with end-users.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

There is an organizer included to the app, so you can keep track of your duties and monitor the overall process.

Social field is one of the largest tax-money consumer in each northern-European countries. Most of those countries aim to sending people to work instead of keeping them on allowances.

ÿ

Our custom design metric system will be used for logging and processing user gameplay data for analysis. The analysis results will help our development team create better gameplay and enhance the user experience of players. Empirical evidence from the game industry has shown that implementing changes in accordance with user analytics has substantially improved game monetization and overall enjoyment of users. Thus this system will bring considerable value to our company.

The system architecture contains 3 modules: logging user data, processing user data (crunching) and displaying analysis result. All the 3 modules will be implemented using FIWARE technologies and enablers.

ÿ

Module 1: Logging user data. In this module, a RESTful web service will be developed for listening to user data collection from the game. User gameplay information will be gathered and stored in Database server in the cloud. The web service will be implemented using FIWARE cloud hosting enabler.

ÿ

Module 2: Processing user data. The data collected will be periodically crunched using Big Data Analysis tools from a cloud server. The same cloud server will receive the crunched result and store it in a different database. This module will use both Cloud Hosting and Data/Context Management Enablers.

ÿ

Module 3: Displaying analysis result. The crunched data will be displayed visually to the game development team via this module. The module's implementation will be a web service using FIWARE cloud hosting enabler.

ÿ

Our custom deep analysis system will give us a much deeper understanding of our player base than what pre made sample based analytics tools provide. This will allow us to fine tune our game to a much greater extent. In any business one of the most important factors is understading your customers. This has never been more true than with mobile apps and games where supply is plentiful and removing a frustrating piece of software is just a tap away.

ÿ

We are also hoping to invite other developers to our platform after the prototype stage to offer them a better way to understand the needs and desires of their user base. This would start to provide us with direct monetary benefit from the system in additon to the value it creates through our games.

The platform will consist of a mobile app that works with a cloud-based back end. At first the app is targeted for shopping centers that want to provide engaging experiences for customers so that they spend more time and money in shopping centers. We have already signed a deal with Citycon, one of the leading shopping center operators in Northern Europe, so that they will roll out the ""Buttefly Hunt"" concept (as this first service instance is called) in January 2015. We foresee huge global potential for the solution and intend to develop it into a scalable concept for ultimately for global markets.

ÿ

Since 1980s Road Agencies have been developing Road Asset Management Systems and Pavement Management Systems in order to better manage the most valuable assets of the country. The value of Finnish road network managed by the Transport Agency is around 15 billion euros and almost 1 billion euros is annually used for road maintenance. Even that data collection methods and road management systems have evolved since the 1980s the road maintenance is not well optimised since implementation of novel machine learning forecasting and optimisation algorithms has been slow and computational capacity has only recently enabled solving such data intensive combinatorial optimisation problems in practice. Also, lifecycles of public sector IT systems tend to be long and implementation of new methods is not therefore continuous.

ÿ

Current problems and need

ÿ

We have identified several problems with the current practice of road asset management both in developed and developing countries. In developing countries a common problem is lack of funding and understanding of the importance of maintenance. Funding is available through international financiers such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, but it is mainly targeted at road construction and reconstruction and not so much on preventive and routine maintenance. Although there are support systems on the market such as very commonly used HDM-4 pavement management system the problem is the complexity of such systems. Another problem is massive requirements for data. Even if these problems are solved the system does not allow real optimisation of multi-year maintenance programmes. When such systems are in place there is a need for data management and IT knowhow. Often this is limited at Road Agencies in developing countries since salaries in the public sector is low and IT experts get employed by more lucrative private sector. As data collection is expensive the valuable data should be at a secure place, but due to neglected IT management backup processes are not in place and data can be permanently lost. Also, the valuable data could be useful for several stakeholders in the country, but it is not opened as it is stored in old systems that run in Local Area Networks. On top of these problems external financing is project-based and lacks maintenance and support budget for the IT systems beyond the project lifetime. 

ÿ

In developed countries the problems are different. Road Agencies are often prisons of the old systems that have been gradually improved and they have become rather massive. Also, there can be several subsystems while a more integrated solution would be more practical and manageable. The same problem is shared with the developing countries that the systems are not really updated during their lifecycle and current research with possibly better algorithms are not implemented in the systems. In the road sector it is also common that the data is not fully opened to the public. Some general basic data is available on web-based GIS such as the road network with weight restrictions, traffic and incidents, but raw data of traffic and condition for example are not opened to the developers.

ÿ

Our approach and solution

ÿ

The purpose of this project is to develop a cloud-based road asset management system that has integrated geographic information system and pavement management system. The idea is that instead of existing desktop applications the system will be web-based, where the backend would be running on a cloud server and front-end runs on a web browser. Figure 1 illustrates the change from the current system architecture with the new system.

ÿ

Our main source of income will be selling In-App and Web advertising with high value targeting possibilities for tourism &amp; creative industry. Here are some main examples of different types of advantages that our service introduces for advertising:

ÿ

#1. We can identify when user is planning travel to some geographic location, we can then give offers &amp; suggestions that are extremely relevant and interesting to the user. More importantly we can advertise the moment when they are doing their travel plans; related to the location they are travelling through. This makes our offers highly relevant for the user, and chance for businesses to find ""perfect moment of sale opportunity"", that was not available before.

ÿ

ÿ

ÿ

#2. We will profile users based on their bucket lists and interests. That gives another opportunity to target generic advertising and offers better than other travel related services that are mainly concentrated only on hotels and restaurants. Our system knows also if the person is interested either in golf or tennis, wine or whiskey etc.

That means, if there is some countryside business doing some art, they can reach art lovers. Wine yards can reach wine lovers, and golf courses will show their adverisements to golf lovers.

ÿ

The product works primarily as a table lamp - so it does not cause users to feel uneasy in adopting a novel form or function. The design features of ?Corona? lamp are timeless and more or less universal. You can use the lamp in living room or in kitchen, in bedroom or in study, in office on in homeoffice.

ÿ

Product?s essential feature, however, is its compatibility with Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi network, enabling it to display a moving animation and information according real-time weather, that is based on GPS location of the users smartphone. On the front and rear displays of the device are illustrative animations, that imitate real-time weather conditions (snow, rain, wind, sun or a cloudness). In addition, it is possible to display the external temperature readings (and optionally also the geographical position).

ÿ

Product?s light element is solved in two parts. The bottom half of the lamp works classically as a table lamp light source, which light intensity can be adjusted via touch sensory dimmable switch on the foot of the lamp. The top half light element can be individually switched on and it is related to the real-time sun activity (sunrise to sunset). According to the sun time variation, the upper element changes the intensity and color of the light. This is a characteristic whereby the product has also received its name ?Corona?, which means the glowing spherical crown around sun. Thereby, the top light element also performs as a kind of therapeutic light mood generator for the environment.

ÿ

The additional feature of the top light element, is possibility to use it as an color therapeutic alarm clock, which you can set up with the smartphone to softly lighten up in right time with a mellow sound signal.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

ÿ

Various courses exist for the education and certification of students on marine traffic rules and regulations. The courses focus on theoretical guidelines on how to navigate in archipelagos, coastal areas and in the high seas, including local and international marine traffic rules and legislation, the use of navigation equipment, and the principles of celestial navigation. Some courses include practical sessions, where students experiment the learnings in the real-world.

ÿ

Due to the principally theoretical nature of the training, the new boat owner often feels unsure on his/her grasp of the subject matter, and launching his/her potentially expensive boat can be a daunting task. Unexperienced, unconfident new seafarers easily find themselves in potentially dangerous situations, posing a risk of material and bodily damage for themselves and others, even loss of life .

ÿ

Though experimenting in the real world is arguably the best way to learn, practicing the theories in a virtual simulation based on real-world scenarios, the users of the proposed software can gain a deeper understanding and master their skills in a safe enviroment. The official requlated curriculum for certification (where applicable) is used as a foundation for the software.

ÿ

In the past, seafaring was a common means of transportation for people in all social groups. Due to the high cost and increasing regulations, it's no longer as popular as it used to be. The software can potentially boost the popularity of boating hobby by means of providing an easy-to-access, multiplatform solution for learning the key skills, especially suitable for the gaming generation. Due to it's regulatory focus, it's a suitable platform for training and refreshing the basics for professional seafarers.

ÿ

Business model

- Sold for various governments for educational purposes, with an additional project inteded for making a local variant, where local legislation is applied, and the software language localized.

ÿ

- Sold through organizations providing training (avoid competion and gaining support for the software)
- Local variants (access license) sold for organizations and residents in supported areas.

ÿ

Re-Usability
The same model and solution would apply for e.g ground-based car traffic simulation, or aviation, but would potentially require more effort and verified high performance and lower network lag.ÿ

UC.Lesson Idea

As I mentioned, we specialize in producing e-learning courses. Our knowlage is based on years of experience in cooperation with the customer in the subject production, delivery and implementation of training.

During operation, we used different tools to produce training such as ToolBook, Captivate, Articulate, but none of them was able to 100% meet our needs. In connection with that 6 months ago we made the decision to begin work on our own program - UC.Lesson

UC.Lesson

UC.Lesson is a tool created by developers for developers and for other, unprofessional users . With it, it will be possible to create various types of interactive presentations, training materials, etc. Which can be used for remote teaching(e-learning). Using this program you will create quickly and easily a project, and then share it on ÿon-line webside. We plan to develop a tool that, despite the large opportunities will be easy to use. Creating a new project in ÿUC.Lessonÿ will be based on adding to it the next slide with the various elements, like in Microsoft?s products. At the end of the work, done presetation ÿwill be ready to be exported to HTML, HTML5, Android, iOS.

The tool which we offerÿ will allow users to create interactive presentations, simulations of the system, knowledge tests and informative lessons very easyly.

At each step of the product may be extended with additional objects like ÿgraphics, text filed, background music orÿ lector?s voice, buttons, questions and other elements. These objects will be compatible with JavaScript and jQuery and will be able to use their libraries.

The prototype of UC.Lesson

The production program is divided into three steps:

1) Terminate the ready ÿprogram with the ability to generate the HTML - version 1.0

2) Terminate the readyÿ module to produce the simulation program - version 2.0

3) Addition to the program ability to generate the HTML5, Android, iOS - version 3.0

So far, we are on the first step developing the program, which is completed at 70%.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

Computer-based imaging can also be produced by an entirely new kind of visual content, which also opens up opportunities for new business models. 3D scanning means a computer model of the production of the real world. 3D scanning is different from, for example, Google Street View of the technique used, which provides a point-panoramic images. These panoramic images, therefore, do not constitute eligible for further processing of the computer model. It can be said that the 3D scan takes real-world virtual imaging to a whole new level of quality. The continuous development of technology follows that the 3D images and modeling the quality level continues to rise and recovery of demand will continue to grow strongly. Until now, the most important 3D image content production method has been to the contents of computer modeling, ie models of the production model of the night people at a time. 3D scanning technology has now reached a level where it becomes a competitive alternative to the traditional computer modeling. 3-D scanning allows for faster 3D modeling than traditional methods, and in addition to the final result is more realistic compared to the traditional methods.

ÿ

It this project, the central idea is to create an online platform for geospatially tagged 3D LIDAR scans, whereÿ

the user can access and visualise the scans using a standard web browser.

The service is similar to ?Google Streetview?, but the main difference is in allowing the users full access to 3D data.ÿ

The data access serves all 3D data based applications, such as 3D visualisation, environmentÿ

planning and real-estate business. Especially this kind of technique gives benefits to movie and entertainment business for looking new locations, ordering hi-resolution backgrounds and/or using ready locations in production as a backplates. For example, scene in movie, what takes place in different country could plan their shooting day in millimetre accurate, or they could use our data as a background while staying in their own country and saving a lot money when shooting this scene in studio. Now days Hollywood uses LIDAR technique almost in all sceneïs.ÿ

ÿ

When a customer orders a 3D scan, the team will enter the site and measure it using a Riegl scanner. The data is preprocessed andÿ

uploaded to a cloud. The customer can access data using standard web browser and see the acquired model with great visual detail. In case the

customer wants to use the data, he buys the model and downloads it. With precise 3D data the customer can measure

distances, plan new infrastructure to the environment and create new 3D assets, that can be uploaded to cloud for

further use. In future, the third-party generated data and models are also accessible via the same platform.

ÿ

MIPsoft has been very successful creating BlindSquare, a GPS orientation aid for blind and partially sighted people used in more than 130 countries. Because the app depends on GPS signals, its reliability inside of buildings is limited. BlindSquare LandMarkers is an indoor navigation system using Bluetooth beacons, which can send signals to modern smartphones. It will help blind and partially sighted users to explore buildings virtually and to locate and navigate to POI inside of buildings.

ÿ

Problem

ÿ

Navigating inside of public buildings (Stations, malls, office buildings) poses different challenges to blind and partially sighted people than travelling in the streets. Outside, visually impaired people often find more landmarks (pavement, tactile paving, different echoes of walls, trees, bushes, fences, audible traffic lights) than are available inside of buildings. Inside office buildings, doors and corridors are similar. In shopping malls, paths are often blocked by signs or decoration, constant background music masks echoes, and other audible clues are lacking. Printed signs are inaccessible to blind individuals. GPS reception generally is too poor to compensate these difficulties using smartphones.

ÿ

Project Description

ÿ

MIPsoft has not only developed BlindSquare, but also CLIS, the Customized Location Information Service. Clis allows organisations to provide customised information about their premises to blind and partially sighted guests, clients, students, or staff who use an iOS-device running BlindSquare or BlindSquare Event. CLIS is already being used successfully at the University of Iowa.

BlindSquare LandMarkers will make CLIS available indoors. Bluetooth beacons will be placed at certain points to provide information or directions.

ÿ

Advantages


	Up to now, most indoor mapping approaches determine the user's position in a building through triangulation. They rely on WiFi, magnetic fields, or beacons to map the building. If WiFi or magnetic fields are used, the location of different places inside a building first have to be entered on the map. Only then can the user be located on the map and receive directions. BlindSquare LandMarkers are simply placed inside the building and are linked to cloud data that can be edited at any time if required. It is not necessary to fingerprint a building and create a map.
	
	
	Other approaches using beacons require that the range of beacons cover all of the building, so it is possible to create a map and use triangulation.
	
	
	We estimate that BlindSquare LandMarkers will require ten times fewer beacons, because this method does not use triangulation. The beacons are placed at important points, like signs or signposts used by sighted people. The user is then guided from beacon to beacon until they reach their destination. Messages received at each beacon depend on the user's direction and the beacons last detected by the user's device. This makes BlindSquare LandMarkers more affordable and easier to install than other systems.
	
	
	There have been other attempts to map indoor locations for blind and partially sighted people. Step-Hear requires that the user wear a special bracelet that vibrates when a transmitter is approached. In contrast to this approach, BlindSquare LandMarkers uses the devices many visually impaired people already own, their smartphones. Bluetooth Beacons are also being produced for the mainstream market. Because BlindSquare LandMarkers does not require custom-made equipment, it is more cost effective than methods that use components specifically designed for visually impaired users.

Car drivers: ""I hate it when I have to drive somewhere and I've got no clue where to park. Where can easily find parking spaces when I'm on the road, especially in city centers?""

Products &amp; Services

A website (later with a mobile application) that enables drivers to type in an address and find parking spaces that they can rent for an hour or more. Via the website the drivers can choose which place they want to rent and when. Owners on the other hand can list their parking spaces to be available at certain times.

Target Market

Geographically the biggest opportunity lies in cities where parking space is difficult to find and/or expensive. In Finland areas like Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Kauniainen, Tampere, Oulu, Jyv„skyl„ and Turku are the most potential ones. Target customers are ones with technical capability to use the service.

Customers can be divided into two sides: owners and drivers. From the owner side the main customers are individuals who own parking spaces, real estate companies that have vacant parking spaces or who want to use the spaces more efficiently and owners of large parking areas. From the other side the customers are the end-users, the drivers, who want an easier and in some cases cheaper way to park their car when they need to.

Sales &amp; Marketing Strategy

Sinunparkki.fi is a classic example of a business that first needs early adopters who can then be followed by the masses. In order to keep both owners and drivers as loyal users of the service it needs to function seamlessly in all ways. The first users can be found via social media, flyers, word-of-mouth, and by targeting real estate companies. Providing real, measurable value for both owners and drivers enables loyalty to form.

Business Model

The business model is based on building an easy to use and reliable web service that connects owners and drivers. When both ends get value from the service it will drive network effects further and enhance the company value in the meantime. Using professionals to code the website by the specs detailed by the founders will result in a service that will deliver the value for owners and drivers.

Competitors

Currently in Finland there isn't this kind of service available, even though it exists for example in the U.S. and the U.K. Therefore the main competitors could be seen in commercial parking garages, which are often located in good places but with very high prices.

Competitive Advantage

Sinunparkki.fi gets the first mover advantage in Finland by being the first one to offer this service. The ÿfounders work at a company that possess expertise in various areas such as parking technology, finance and entrepreneurship. Also, they have a good network of professionals in different areas that can prove to be helpful in the process of developing the service.

Sinunparkki.fi is a platform that connects parking space owners, who want to earn money from the time their space is not used by themselves, and car drivers who want an easy way to find a space to park their cars where ever they may be, without paying ridiculous amounts of money.

Creating value for both car drivers and parking space owners by providing a platform that connects both drivers and owners.

The main challenge is to be the first company to enter the market and make it not only profitable, but a long-term business. Possible changes in legislation or customer behavior are risks.

ÿ

The product: An application that turns physical exercise into social online gaming experience. The mobile application is free to use for consumers, and professional trainer versions and retailer versions are licenced. Professional trainers can manage groups and create games for their customers, retailers can create challenge games that come with monetary rewards such as discounts for sporting equipment or supplements, free passes to gyms etc. Income is generated by licensing fees, advertising and possibly through in-game purchases.

ÿ

Key concept:ÿ Gamified Self

The approach is a mix quantified personal exercise and gamificationÿ that motivates people to improve their personal health &amp; well-being. Motivation comesÿthrough game-like challenges and achievements, social aspect and monetary benefits (discounts, freebies, gifts, prices) that measure and reward players' progress. Key factors in the game are motivation, rewarding and sharing. Rewarding &amp; sharing bring in the business of sports equipment retail and sporting events as well as personal training and guided exercise services. Physical exercise itself is the game. This involves starting point (in terms of the player's initial fitness level) and completing a set of milestones/levels/trophies in order to reach specific goals within some feasible time window. The games can be customized to fit the end users skills and capabilities thus making it feasible for all users from beginners to advanced. The actual physical exercise in the game can be any sport that allows measuring individual's performance in some meaningful way, including, but not limited to GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, self-reporting, and potentially other means of measurement as well.

ÿ

The applications: 

- The basic mobile app will be free of charge. Free version has some limitation such as game creation and customization. Paid version of the app unlocks all limitations and allows unlimited personal use. Web-based access to the game account will also be needed

- Commercial personal trainers/gyms can get a subscription license for the service of creating gaming events for groups of people. The licence pricing will depend on the number of people allowed in groups. Web access for creating and managing these groups and monitoring and rewarding progress.

- Sports equipment retailers get a subscription license for product and service promotion. Retailers can push advertising messages back to mobile app users (free version users). Retailers can also create gaming events that come with rewards. Users get messages from the retailers about the upcoming rewards. The rewards are ""fit"" to match the player profile and the game.

ÿ

Example use scenario:

- A mobile app user selects from one of the publicly available exercise programs and follows it, gaining points and rewards, tracking their own progress

- Several users take on the same challenge and compare their progress in the challenge, engageing in friendly competition

- A personal trainer creates an exercise program for a group of people. The game is the same for everyone, but achievements may be customized based on group members' personal fitness level.

- A retailer creates a challenge for users, with prizes such as running shoes for the winner or a year's worth of sporting supplements, randomly given to 10 people who finish a given challenge.

The ideology of Giffee is that you can send small treats to your friend to make their day. Giffee is all about positive experiences and very positive customer engagement.

Imagine you see on Facebook that your friend is having a birthday and you are abroad on a business trip. Buying and sending a gift is not possible and writing a message to their wall doesn?t feel like enough. With Giffee you can choose your friend favorite treat and when you send it forward they will receive a QR code to her phone and/or e-mail, which they use when collecting the gift from the shop. Let?s say your friend loves the Cappuchino and a cupcake at the local cafeteria on their way to work. They will be extremely happy of your gift! And when they are collecting the gift the cafeteria is getting very positive customer engagement. They will be so happy about this that they will send it forward to their friend. So it is creating virality.

Production music is the type of music used typically in TV and film productions. While the industry is evolving, the requirement for quality music remains: distribution platforms like YouTube and Vimeo only increase the market.

ÿ

The project team has members with different backgrounds that perfectly support each other: a film and tv-movie director, a composer, a serial entrepreneur and a technical architect with background in software development for broadcasting. The team members will thus bring instant feedback from customer perspective both as a composer and a director. With their industry connections locating the first productions to use Nuotta music should not be a problem.

ÿ

This service will involve building a portal website as the main communication and collaboration facility for information and content exchange. As addition to the portal website there will be a CRM system to manage user accounts, billing and to generate various reports on transactions. The document workflow will be fully automated and the system is capable of processing royalty payments and usage fees automatically. The service is highly scalable and can be localized into new countries at a reasonable cost.

ÿ

The website / portal will be an important tool for the Nuotta ?project to communicate with members, general public and other, related groups and it will be the main tool to support collaboration between composers and producers. It is important to involve active users in the planning and design of the new solution and to document the established requirements for the new system.

ÿ

Our service solves two main problems: where to go and and possibility to pay via mobileÿwithout leaving the table and leaving the company of friends. This will give more time to enjoy night-out experience.

ÿ

Communication between clients and target group service providers will be organized through smart devices, for example smartphones, smartwatches or tablets. Through our application we can provide additional information to clients from the service providers, including for example evening programmes, events, customer campaigns. This will attract more customers and will generate more profit to the service provider. For clients who use this application will get first more information which place to choose and more enjoyable night because of better solution for ordering and paying.

ÿ

Idea

ÿ

Main target is to use this service on different nightclubs, restaurants, pubs and fast-food restaurants, where it has the greatest impact making the experience more pleasurable and faster for both the clients and provider. Additionally our service can make target group of providers business more profitable and smoother. At the moment there is a bottle neck problem, meaning that for example when the house is full, waiters and barmen cannot fulfill the demand. As a client it is frustrating to order more when the place is overcrowded and there is a need to stand in the long line for ordering. It will reduce the hesitation for client to order more giving extra income for service providers. As an side opportunity via this application customers can also order drinks and sweets to other tables, for example to make a romantic gesture to a beautiful lady/gentleman. It will be managed using the floor plan and table locations of specific service provider.

ÿ

The process will look like this:

We will work out appropriate solution for specifc business, cooperating with owner of the placeÿ(our client)ÿwho provides all the relevant information needed - floor plan, locations of the tables, menu, pricing, discounts, information of events
	Customer downloads our application, places order and pays via smart device
	Service provider gets the detailed information of the order
	Order will be executed fast and precisely - wihtout handling any physical cash.ÿInsertion of orders is fully digital, fast and cash-free (optional), which would exclude mistakes and sets waiters free of very time consuming billing of clients. This way it leaves more time for waiter to concentrate to the needs of customer and communicating quality
	ÿ
Our service gives better opportunitiesÿfor the client to enjoy the evening, local programme (artists, live musicians), socializing with friends and acquaintances. Client does not need to stand up from the table, go and wait in the line - which all in together can be very time consuming and stressful.

Our application may drastically reshape culture of visiting restaurants and pubs. We can apply our service in very wide scale of service providers and in different cities globally. First target is to occupy market in Estonia and Scandinavia.

There is a growing niche emerging around physical skills, such as gymnastics, parkour and tricking. The practitioners of any physical skills? sub-niche are usually interested in other related sub-niches.


Those interested in physical skills typically form local groups and share their expertise in the Internet using forums, YouTube, social media and websites. A good example is a YouTube video which shows how to learn a certain move or skill, step by step.


Physical skills enthusiasts suffer from dispersion and low quality of tutorials. Content providers have difficulties in reaching their potential customers, and this makes it difficult to commercialize and monetize their content efficiently.

The Solution


The dispersion of quality content and difficulties with monetization are a problem both to consumers and content providers. That?s why we have decided to create a virtual shopping centre for physical skills enthusiasts. We provide a centralized mobile platform, which gathers all physical skills enthusiasts together and enables content providers to sell their expertise.


Our platform will not only be the ultimate marketplace for learning physical skills, but also creates a whole new way of learning these skills. The skills are learned progressively, step by step, and the learning process is gamified. We have adapted elements and terminology from role-playing video games, such as skilltrees and levels. This clear, visual and immersive learning method makes learning new skills extremely fun, even intoxicating.


The user can access the most relevant content ? in the form of a game-like skilltree ? straight from the home screen of the app instead of spending hours surfing around the internet, which is time-consuming and frankly a pain in the ass. In addition, the user doesn?t need a constant internet connection to access the tutorials since the content can be downloaded on user?s device to be accessed offline.


Our goal is to make our platform the new standard of providing high quality physical-skills-related content to potential customers. Those content creators who want to make themselves stand out the way they deserve will never want to use any other delivery system again. The reasons end-users choose Level App are large supply combined with great user-experience.

Where Does the Money Come From?


We help the seller meet their client, and we do it fast. We provide the marketplace, concept and tools toÿtransform their content into gamified form, and we take a provision of all transactions performed using our platform.


To the end customers we provide an unique, immersive and gamified user-experience. To the content producers we provide the largest audience available and the tools to transform their new or already existing content into top-quality information products which sell for a great price in the most wanted format known in the physical skills niche ? it is skilltrees.


Skilltree is a group of challenges put in the form of the tree. The skilltree climax is the final challenge, such as backflip. In order to reach the final challenge, the user has to accomplish easier challenges. This mechanism is familiar from role-playing video games and makes leveling up rewarding. The result is gamified step-by-step learning process made available by our platform.


Content provider can create a skilltree just dragging and dropping the content in its place using our skilltree editor, and skilltree editor transforms the content into a skilltree.


The skilltree format and audience centralization are factors that make content providers want to forget about YouTube and Facebook, and sell their expertise as skilltrees using Level App platform.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

After providing the required coaching we help the startups to connect to the markets around them while making available multiple free and charged support services for the startups (we are getting lots of experienced advisors, investors and consulting partners aboard). Our business is creating value around us both for investors, vendors, startups and the community in general.

ÿ

We have now acquired some considerable high profile partners for our project already. We have acquired (TBP) big partners with whom we have close and joint efforts to kick-start our platform. We have one of the biggest startup sites in northern Europe with us to help us reach our target audience. The other partner is a Finnish company listed in NASDAQOMXH stock exchange and who will provide some software support and business consulting services to be added on the platform. We describe our business model as a win-win-win-win for all joining the V2V community; everybody wins from service providers to the startups and their projects.

ÿ

We tackle the two biggest obstacles for startups scaling up their business: raising capital and entering new unfamiliar markets. It is extremely challenging for European startups and small enterprises to take the first step and to enter these new bigger markets (even within the still not-too-integrated European markets). Moreover, it is even more difficult and expensive to do it from your home location if you didn?t start in some of the business capitals of the world. Global scale (or at least regional markets) however should be the target market from the get-go for every reasonably scalable business. Finland is simply too small for most of the new ideas to get the required traction to lift off the ground even; building a startup is never easy and doing it only (e.g.) in Finland and your small local market is 100 times more difficult

ÿ

As said, it is costly and too much of leap for most of the startups to have the full physical presence to succeed in a foreign market, even after they receive seed funding. You need something between ?the ignoring the big markets altogether? and on the other hand ?having a local office and sales operations abroad?. We can provide that ?something between? through our online portal and physical go-to-market integration. There is an unquestionable demand for this kind of service connecting the required pieces when taking the next steps commercializing your project and building the company around your vision. Our portal and p2p-community becomes extreme helpful when entering the new not-too-familiar markets. Export industry is an old term that describes old heavy industries, in creative industries you have to be local and global at the same time. Export describes just a fraction what entering to new market means, you have to be global and local -- ?glocal?. 

ÿ

We have seen which market entry models work and which do not. To do business, for example, in US you will need a physical presence of some sort, and the minimum requirements can be achieved with the combination of online preparations and some physical tools. V2V portal and community can provide you the minimum physical presence as well through the mail/call forwarding and conference room services as well as an easy access to local industry contacts.

ÿ

At the same time, we tackle the problem from another direction. As funding is the biggest obstacle for many startups -- and it is even bigger problem in terms of executing overseas operations (in any extent) -- we will (and already have) team up with some VCs, business angels (networks) and crowdfunding platforms to crop the most potential startups. Nevertheless, our goal is to provide holistic solutions, so we must be able to fund our member startups and their market ambitions. Moreover, elementary level of physical presence in the market is practically the only way to attract early investments from abroad for your startup (generally, 5 times easier at least according to a few sources). So we are in the business of tackling the most important obstacles startups usually have to counter.

ÿ

In general the portal is an instrument to facilitate commerce by bringing together service providers and our startup members.ÿSome basic services will be offered for free and some are negotiated to be discounted but the idea is to bring value for everyone joining the community, for the member startups, the investors and the consulting and coaching services alike. The core functionality of the portal is to create a total package of market entry support while creating a marketplace to provide a uniform service interface to discover and match different needs from different sides of the table. 

ÿ

The core functionalities provide a basis for extended services, such as office and conference room and specific market entry services (e.g. legal). FIWARE enabler Marketplace SAP IR looks to provide a very promising match to build the service portal on, although we might have to fix it to fit our needs a little bit first and to build it more community-based. FIWARE enablers, WStore and Revenue Settlement and Sharing system would have to be integrated into that as well. All in all, using these few selected FIWARE enablers appears to be the most sensible and efficient approach available for us considering our resources and timeline. (We are planning to build the presales and crowdfunding components out of the aforementioned WStore and RSS components in a way or another. Other enablers have not been excluded at this point.)",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,0,#N/A

GBerry utilizes equipment found from ordinary homes: TV screens with audio devices, tablets and mobile phones. TV is used for showing main game events while mobile devices are used for controlling game and showing possible secret information for each player. Free GBerry application can be downloaded into mobile devices from mobile application stores. This general purpose application is used with all games. With these concepts GBerry attacks especially to niches of multiplayer and family games.

ÿ

Like hardware also the gaming platform software will be available under open source. Essential part of GBerry ecosystem is a webstore from where games can be bought. Everyone is welcome to develop a game and sell it in GBerry webstore. In fact GBerry encourages young developers into game development by providing easy to use programming environment. On the other side of ecosystem there is co-operation platform where artists, musicians and developers can join their forces to build a game and share revenue. In addition to games GBerry webstore is used also for selling game resources ? graphics, sounds, music ? and game libraries for game developers.

ÿ

Other essential part of GBerry ecosystem are credits ? micro payment system. Customers can buy bundles of credits and actual games are paid using these credits. This way games can be low cost, like from few cents to 1?, and different licensing models can be easily innovated. For example paying for each day that game is actually used. A credit wallet is also easy to share with other family members. This way children don't need to have own payment methods.

It will consist of digital games, books, educational material, animations, stuffed animals and other merchandise.

ÿ

Rounders are animal characters with round figures. The characters are easily approachable. They each have their own unique personality traits.The adventures of the Rounders are fun and entertaining for children of all ages. In the heart of the stories you can always find a lesson of socio-emotional skills.Rounders live in Sunny Cloud. It is a magical place where anything can and will happen.ÿ

ÿ

Rounders game is an educational and entertaining game for young children, teaching emotional intelligence. The game is for both solo play and social activity. The game connects the physical world and the virtual world by using geotagged Open Data streams. The introduction of real-world places and phenomena will bring the experience closer to real life and enhance the transfer of learned emotional skills to everyday life. By matching players by physical proximity has also the potential to connect children with real-life social groups.

ÿ

The Rounders game is an online multiplayer game for children aged 4 to 10. But instead of fighting wars or battling in dungeons, children will share emotions and learn how to cope better with negative emotions like anger or jealousy. Sharing emotions with Rounders characters and other players the child will learn positive solutions for everyday situations e.g. how to get over temper tantrums.

ÿ

For example Cranky Crabbie has had a really difficult morning and you can help him by giving him emoticons of your choosing. E.g. if you give him hugs, it is easier for him to wake up. And if you add a few cheers emoticons you can see how Cranky Crappie?s day will turn into a happy one. But if you give him a hissy fit, his day will turn into a cranky one.

ÿ

All players will see what emoticons other players have given to the characters. The amount of emoticons will influence in witch path the character will go. Children will learn how their emotions and choices affect them.

ÿ

Children can create their own 3D characters with simple tools. (In the future, perhaps you can print your own character with a 3D printer.) With geolocation we bring players in physical proximity into the same environment in-game. E.g. Rounders can organize a dance competition or a pop concert in the physical world, and while attending the event, all players will share the same space inside the Rounders game.

ÿ

Game platform uses Open Data sources to enrich Rounders environment. E.g. Helsinki city has an Open Data source for landscaping information that provides detailed data about parks, forests, and the common environment. When the player is in Helsinki, the Rounders environment will mirror their physical location - if they are in park physically, their character in the game is inside a park (or forest). The game will eventually have APIs for 3rd party developers to connect external data sources to the game.ÿ

Each day such operators lose hugh amounts of revenue because of this. Thus, they are open to conversation with parties that have viable business solutions which will positively drive revenue and growth.

Taganize is the market leader in activating NFC chips and QR codes. Our select partner, CloudStreet, is also a market leader in cloud based capacity exchange where Advertisers and TV production companies can buy mobile network capacity for their live events or transmission needs.

ÿ

CloudStreet's technology ties IP traffic priority with physical locations and time. CloudStreet prioritization technology enables mobile operators to provide network capacity for specific users at specific locations during a specific periods in time.


Although CloudStreets technology significantly reduces the production costs for live TV transmissions and broadcasting, a challenge exists in how to crowd source potential users into 'live' events including: concerts, advertising promotions or even sporting events?

ÿ

To solve this problem Taganize will create an Android app that can read specially coded Taganize NFC chips and QR codes. During any 'live' event mobile users will not have the required app and/or a correctly provisioned app needed to stream live video. By touching a Taganize NFC chip or scanning a QR code, users can download/provision the required app and/or settings needed in order to stream live video from the event. Not only will mobile users be able to start streaming live HD video from the event in real time but more importantly they WILL NOT have to fiddle with the challenges associated with provisioning an app and all its settings onto the network! Everything needing to happen will occur with touch and go Taganize simplicity.

ÿ

The implications of creating this app are enormous and widespread as it will enable Taganize to expand it's product portfolio in many ways! When we think of public safety for instance, Taganize will now be able to sell it's own line of security products that can be displayed in public and private places.

After holding several meetings with artisans from the leather and footwear industry in Mallorca and once analysed their needs and requirements, at Mark Site we decided to work on creating a simple application, yet very comprehensive in its connection with social networks (massive markets) because European have to compete with semi-artisanal products produced in developing countries with a considerable reduction in production costs. ÿÿ

The Application

Craftsmapp intends to convince the Majorcan artisan industry, an industry that includes from self-employed artisans to internationally renowned artisan factories such as Camper (footware) or Munper (leather fashion), that by use of new technologies it is possible to reach a younger audience that requires a different kind of marketing that makes them feel like shopping in markets of factory outlets located around the island. Once the feasibility of the project is verified locally the idea is to implement it in other European municipalities famous for their highly valued artisanal products.

Craftsmapp is an application that links tourists to typical artisan products from different European municipalities. This connection will be possible exponentially thanks to propagation on social networks.

Its success is based on the simplicity of its use for both users and traders as well as the connection with social networks.


With two simple steps, tourists can visualize the product and its features, its history, price and where to buy it through geographic location. Users can also post it on their social networks and give it a score.

ÿ

Media and content have a strong influence on technological, societal and business strategies within the context of the Future Internet, taking into consideration the high social impact of the participation and interactivity of end users.

ÿ

One sector that is progressively entering this new paradigm is journalism and news gathering. News gathering is the process of creating a story, from finding sources and facts to coming up with a story angle. Different types of stories require different reporting processes, but all of them need to lay on four main pillars: truthfulness, closeness, appealing and quality.

TSUNAMI project aims at bringing together these two worlds, both Future Internet and journalism, by emphasizing on three key aspects: the user, the service and the content. Each one of them is a powerful force by itself, able to explain current evolution of media-based services consumption: content-centric services designed for improved targeted-user experience. ÿ

TSUNAMI is a content-driven news-oriented platform, where a content-specific service is tuned to cope with the content-centric paradigms offering, on-demand and live news-media distribution, news-content publishing and consumption.

ÿ

On the other hand, TSUNAMI will provide end-users with innovative tools which will allow them to acquire and deliver live video streams directly from their smart devices (i.e. smartphones and tablets), supporting both Android and iOS. The capability of transmitting content independently from the location is a priceless feature that will empower users to delivery real-time media in a highly efficient manner. Journalism is a clear use case where this technology may have a huge impact. TSUNAMI will offer an extremely easy-to-set-up bundle for quick video capturing ensuring high quality performance for the system. 

ÿ

TSUNAMI integrates a live streaming application. It will be based on HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), a communications protocol that supports both live broadcast and pre-recorded content (i.e. video on-demand). HLS is capable of managing multiple alternate streams at different bit rates, allowing the client software to switch streams intelligently as the network bandwidth changes. Hence, TSUNAMI will be able to adapt the streaming process at run time attending the network conditions. Thus, the best quality will be always provided and the Quality of Services of professional environment will be covered.

In addition, HLS provides tools for media encryption and user authentication over HTTPS, allowing publishers to protect their inputs. 

Additionally, TSUNAMI will be able to join the consumers and professionals in terms of content formats and content managing. TSUNAMI will offer automatic connectivity and compatibility of the platform contents and the streaming services with the state of the art workflows of professional video content generators as broadcasters and mass media. Any content from TSUNAMI can be ingested into CDN services for web delivery and in HD-SDI (coaxial or fiber) production environments. Finally, in terms of the property rights of the videos management, TSUNAMI will work through Creative Commons (CC) licenses.

4. Incorporate 360? spherical images to improve user experience.

ÿ

ÿ

Our solution
Boost visits and sales by establishing a link between the commerce and the potential buyer. This link would be established by using a low cost system combining web, mobile and beacons technology:

ÿ

Access to detailed information of the shop
	Report of the establishment in real-time
	Attracting customers through active messages using push technology ""Beacon""
	Mapping the distribution of customers through technology ""Beacon""
ÿ

The data are incorporated through a CMS and nourish a site map (ready to be embedded in the web of each establishment) and a free app and multilanguage (Android and iPhone) with details of the different establishments: images on 360 degree, PDFs, videos, AR, QR code reader, etc. The most important point of this system would combine recommender algorithms based on artificial intelligence with technology ""Beacon"" (emitting device and a Bluetooth link that facilitateÿ a link ""type of establishment - user ""). This system will allow, for example, send notices about offers, coupons and other incentives. Additionally, it also allows to create distribution maps with variables such as time of stay in a particular sector or total users, without the need to open the app. The business model is based on a monthly or annual fee for each establishment incorporated entitling the installation of a ""Beacon"" in the shop, information management of each trade and access to the users distribution maps on the shaft commercial.

ÿ

Relevant degree at national and international level:

The ""Beacon Technology"" was presented by Apple in December 2013, ie, which has about 11 months. So, it's very new technology and it's in the first steps of its real implementation. In september 2014 will begin the commerce of the 360 degree cameras with ""popular"" prices (below 700 ?) and high level of usability. Currently, the systems to generate 360 degree images are very complex and the price can go up to around ? 3,000 at least.

Systems that respond and interact to users based on artificial intelligence algorithmsÿ only be able to start applying to the mobile environment from the onset of the latest generation of phones (more powerful and screens quality). Previously, the hardware and software of mobile devices did not allow the proper use of this technology raised.

255,CREA255,CREA,CREAtiFi,Spain,Magicbox Television and Interactive Services SL,SAME - Emergency alert and message system for cross-platform television,"C/Malvarrosa 7, 28937 Mostoles, Spain",Consumer other,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Daniel Castro Garcia,"The project will allow citizens to receive alerts and emergency messages on their TVs using the European standard HbbTV, available in 100% of SmartTVs sold in Europe since 2012, and with an annual growing rate of 20%.

The messages are generated through FI-Ware sensors cloud scattered through the city, and supervised by security forces, emergency institutions and other public authorities to avoid false alarm triggering (police, firemen, health authorities, city council?) or directly generated by authorities.

These messages will be broadcasted OTA (Over The Air), through the same digital TV signal as the regular broadcast TV channels (including DVB-T/ISDB/ATSC digital television standards, and satellite transmission using the DVB-S/S2 standards), and without requiring an Internet connection. Alarms will be automatically received, filtered based on geographical area affected, risk level and severity, and instantly displayed on HbbTV SmartTV equipped homes.

Depending on the alert severity, the message could be displayed either as a brief message (press red key to receive an alert message), a banner at the bottom of the screen partially overlapping the broadcast emission, of a full-screen message in case of a high risk emergency situation.

ÿ

The emergency message will be also accompanied by additional information in form of an explicative audio or video, a web formatted page with more in-deep data related to the alert, etc. This information could come through OTA (Over The Air) or Internet, so that the HbbTV-compatible TV could receive information coming from both the broadcast antenna and the broadband channel if the TV is connected to the Internet.

ÿ

However, the service takes advantage of the broadcast nature of TV. Although it makes use of broadband access if available, it is not a requisite and is designed to allow alert triggering without Internet connection: In case of emergency, mobile networks usually suffer service outages and thus mobile devices are of no use. However, broadcast stations are usually less affected than mobile networks and are able to provide the service without interruption, effectively complementing tablets and smartphones.

ÿ

Example of alerts could include the following:

Weather alerts (hurricanes, storms, floods?)
	Gas or water shut offs due to breakdown or planned works.
	Anticipated electric power shut offs due to planned works
	Nuclear or chemical hazards
	Evacuation alerts, bomb or other terrorist attack warnings.
	Traffic alerts related to severe accidents or road cutoffs
	Recommendations in case of emergencies (evacuation routes, instructions on how to proceed, etc.)
	Other alerts not necessarily provided by FI-Ware sensors, but leveraging on FI-Ware cloud infrastructure: food alerts, medical drugs or other product withdrawal, missing persons, etc.
ÿ

SAME provides a new service around connected TV that complements the traditional broadcast experience with alerts and related information using rich multimedia content such as professionally produced videos and other creative media, thus intensifying cooperation between creative industries such as broadcast and multimedia / Internet content developers.

ÿ

The system will also be extended to other worldwide standards: Ginga-J, SmartTV SDKs from Samsung, LG, Philips? , Android 4TV based devices, and proprietary interactive TV middlewares in use though IPTV and cable platforms.

ÿ

The project idea has already been presented to several potential customers that expressed their interest in the project:

City councils of Malaga, Seville and Santander
	SAMUR (emergency services from Madrid - Spain)
	Canal Sur, RTVE (Spanish broadcasters)
	Secretariat of Telecommunications of the Mexican government

This creative process has different problems and risks:

ÿ

1) mental processes decrease in efficiency with time;

2) there is a growing number of resources that experts follow for inspiration, most of which involve expensive team meetings (i.e. brainstorming or customer panels);

3) there are other potential bottlenecks like blank paper syndrome or mental blocks, which add uncertainty to the process.

ÿ

Creative experts need inspiration and agencies need more cost-effective and efficient workflows. ÿ

ÿ

The value proposition of Stoorm Flow is a digital-based process to generate and consume divergent ideas relevant to a project brief, such as a marketing campaign assignment. This process helps creative professionals to build ?research paths? to explore ideas from different angles (objectives, causes, everyday stories, metaphors, etc.), and then classify and filter them in order to find a creative solution. In essence, the Stoorm Flow engine is a generator of ideas that supports a divergent exploration of information, rather than a convergent search such as in search engines.

ÿ

The core technology of Stoorm Flow is a set of algorithms and methods that crawl the web through search engines and social media APIs, identifying and filtering creative and original ideas expressed in natural language. It includes semantic analysis algorithms to decompose phrases into iconic words and expressions, and look for representative images. Part of these algorithms are patentable and currently kept as industrial secret. Essentially, Stoorm Flow brainstorms the web relentlessly, divulging concrete ideas, and helping creatives to berrypick and organize them. It can also learn from its users and keep all the ideas it generates alongside user comments and their evaluation. In this manner, Stoorm Flow helps creatives in diversifying their creative paths and also helps them to converge efficiently onto the ?big idea?.

ÿ

The first product prototype planned is a personal APP that allows users create a brief, generate and rate ideas, and share them with their teammates collaborating on the search for a specific idea or theme (e.g. for a marketing campaign). Teammates store the ideas they generate in a shared portfolio to facilitate collaboration, they can also filter and grade the ideas they receive in order to pick the most adequate ones(s) collaboratively. Subsequently, we are planning to develop a series of specialized products, each addressing a different generic use case (e.g., searching for a marketing idea, a company name, a slogan, a motto for a political campaign, etc).

ÿ

The first business model adopted for this stage is a Business-to-Business Software-as-a-Service. Companies in the creative business (e.g., advertising agencies) buy brief* packages as credits, which are consumed by their creative teams as they use the APP to look for ideas. Companies own the ideas they generate, but our platform learns from successful cases to better its outcome in future cases. Our previous evaluation tests with the seven companies show that the use of our technology reduced the cost of the ideation process by 50%, made ideation more productive and enjoyable, and tended to democratize it.

ÿ

But this is only one example of the multiple possibilities that Videona is offering to smartphone users:

ÿ


	A highly professional editing tool will be provided to users, easy to use and adapted to the smartphone characteristics.
	
ÿ


	Users will be able to edit their own videos or the ones from others, in real time, while they are being recorded; this way they turn to be coeditors and, if desired, they will also have real time support.
	
ÿ


	Videona will offer: incredible features for an improved recording, the use of simultaneous cameras, useful gadgets attached to the camera, superpose augmented reality objects to videos or just contextual information without requiring the user to be a professional recorder!
	
ÿ


	Videona is empowering users by giving them the opportunity to select the most appropriate licence for the videos, enabling a Creative Commons approach. This makes the original authors the only ones to decide where, how or when others can use their videos.
	
ÿ


	Users sharing the same hobbies, interests or attending the same events can communicate in a purely video-oriented social network, since it is linking the same kind of users.
	
ÿ

Gamification is a key to boost Videona. According to 2011 Gartner Research report, ?it?s estimated that by 2015, more than 50 percent of organizations that manage innovation processes will gamefy those processes?. Videona works with a reward system typical of gaming, which is through gains. This way the user sees how his participation is being prized with improvements and upgrades helping the network grow while keeping the pleasure of competing.

This app is mainly addressed to digital natives, this is young people within 18 to 34 years old. Because cellphones are turning to be the device most used to connect to the Internet. For example, in Spainin 2013, more than 60% of users connected to the web did it through their cellphone. Internationally though, numbers get higher and the forecast is encouraging, at the end of 2014 the use of smartphones will reach 1,75 billion. ÿ

They are traditionally classified as seven, one per each muse: Painting, Architecture, Sculpture, Music, Poetry, Dance and Theater/Cinema. Although painting is one of the eldest art expressions a growing community of modern artists has extended the practice of using computers to paint color onto a digital canvas, which can be also printed onto traditional canvas.

ÿ

GxPaint addresses the development of new forms of pictorial art taking advantage of new technologies that are appearing on the market. Specially, immersive virtual reality technologies such as Oculus Rift.ÿOculus Rift is a new virtual reality headset that lets people step inside their favorite games and virtual worlds. Nowadays, with the advent of 3D computing and affordable headsets, it is already possible to walk around in virtual representations of buildings and cities. Inside these virtual worlds, physical constraints such as gravity or pressure are also virtual elements that can be removed.

ÿ

GxPaint aims to design and develop a virtual world in order to allow artists to create a new kind of art based on virtual reality techniques. Artists will be able to paint in a virtual environment using any type of texture, color, line, thickness and countless adjustments.

ÿ

GxPaint will be the very first tool that will transform the process of creating art into a 3D action. This new art creation will not be limited to a physical canvas, which is linked to material considerations and usual physics, allowing the artist to express her/his creativity in un unlimited way and also being able to incorporate elements from real world.

ÿ

GxPaint will also be a valuable tool for teaching drawing techniques. An artist will be able to save not only her/his artistic creation but also, most importantly from a student point of view, the exact process through which this artistic expression has been created. Students will be able to watch the whole process through GxPaint.

ÿ

Furthermore, GxPaint will change the rules of traditional painting. Before doing a paint stroke, artists will be able to see the exact consequences of that stroke onto the digital canvas. Artist will also have the possibility to undo or redo any previous action carried out onto the digital canvas. This feature will also help artists to paint digital drafts to try colors and techniques before painting an actual canvas.

ÿ

It will be thus possible to paint onto any kind of canvas. The size of the canvas will not be a problem anymore because in a virtual world, artists can get an endless mobility to reach every part of the canvas.

ÿ

GxPaint will allow artists to curate their creations and put them in an environment of their choosing. This will permit people from all over the world to visit an artist environment and see her/his pictures and other creations at closer range.

ÿ

Finally, with GxPaint, it might be possible to add sounds and interactivity to artistic creations. Therefore, artistic creations performed with GxPaint will actually become immersive virtual worlds.

ÿ

Thanks to FIWARE GxPaint will be able to benefit of a large number of capacities out of the box. Thanks to FIWARE, GxPaint will be able to store creations in the cloud and to build a community of artists and students sharing their painting knowledge. GxPaint will also provide streaming of videos of recorded experiences and real time streaming. FIWARE will help EUROB to reduce the infrastructure costs derived from the deployment of the needed algorithms which will process the services provided by GxPaint.

The platform also functions as a self-distribution tool for independent filmmakers and content owners. Revenues are split among the service provider, content owner and exhibitor with no financial risk.

With the addition of the FIWARE Enablers, which is the aim of this proposal, we will boost our productivity and service with Big Data analysis and revenue sharing tools among the multiple stakeholders (Movie Theaters, Right holders, VAT, SGAE, DAMA, AISGE, AIE as Right Management entities, Ymagis or Arts Alliance for the Virtual Print Fee, Admit One for the ticketing and choosing the seat, the bank for the TPV, the promoter that gets a 5% of the net incomes, and ourselves).

ÿ

This evolution of Screenly + the FIWARE Enablers is called: Screenly Big Data.

The Business idea for Screenly is to give to the audience the chance to participate in the programming of independent films which they may have missed or which were not offered nearby. For exhibitors and content owners, Screenly maximizes all the possible benefits for the sector that crowd ticketing offers in terms of feedback from users, visibility, community engagement, market research, and ticket management.

The goal is to become the reference platform of Cinema on Demand in the south of Europe, built on innovation and the participative economy.

Screenly provides a technological platform based on a ?Software as a Service? (SaaS) concept that brings innovation, transparency and a free financial risk tool to the film distribution sector. With the FIWARE enablers we will have the tools to deliver a better service to our different clients (either distribution companies, final user, or movie theaters) and have a distinctive analytics and marketing tools that makes ours an outstanding service compared to our competitors.

Screenly Big Data is the implementation of big data analysis tools, provided among the FIWARE enablers, that will allow us to improve the distribution of the content to the users. We will use the technology to process amounts of previously stored data in order to get relevant insights to suggest more relevant films and documentaries to our users. A better service for a happier user.

With the CREATIFI grant we will also develop a mobile app that allows, through a glanceable user interface (a Tinder type interface, to be clear) and gamification, a tool for selecting your favorited/hated movies. Swipe to the left you hate that one, swipe to the right, you love this one. After several decisions the user makes, we will be able to understand better is taste, thus being able to suggest and recomend movies.

Screenly Big Data will permit private access to the platform to content owners and exhibitors that allows them to experiment with different fees in order to obtain the maximum income possible depending on different factors such as the content itself, showtime and theatre room. As result of that, the technological platform will be able to automatically set the parameters on the minimum number of seats to be sold in every event. Therefore establishing the possibility for an event to be carried out without any financial risk to any of the parties.

With the FIWARE enablers we will be able to create visualizations for the ?content rights holders?

WIVI is the wine app focus on users not wine experts but wine lovers. The main successful of this app is the way of how we provide the info (augmented reality search engine) and the kind of info (daily basics info) our target need to get more info according to their needs.
Although we are from Europe which is the mother house of wine culture we detect some business opportunities in this sector. On one side people who usually drinks wine has serious doubts to decide which bottle of wine they should buy in a shop or order in a bar, the thing is that they always associate wine time with plans (dinner with the couple, afterwork, family meeting, friends celebrating?). WIVI will recommend them a perfect bottle in real time filling several parameters as type of plan, food/wine pairing and quality rating preferred.
They will be able also to compare a few bottles of the shop to get ratings on the parameters above mentioned. To sum up we will make their decisions easier because what they can find until now is complicate info of each bottle described in an expert language and rating points of that wine, nothing else. We believe that wine culture should encompass more aspects like ?feelings? which are basic on the buying decision.
ÿ
This buying decision is what our clients?(wineries) needs to optimise with the aim of increasing their sales. WIVI will get users details, taste, location and their community?s info, all this data will make us the perfect channel for wineries to promote their wines, to connect with their clients, to offer another point of view of their product and to have the opportunity of influence at the time of their consumers buying decision. Our business opportunity is real due to the lack of wine platforms in mobile to develop marketing strategies, there are no mobile channels to invest in advertising formats. And in the other hand wineries are demanding more knowledge of their consumers, more contact with them, more control of their products and also platforms to show their hard daily work.
The app is also intended to serve as a showcase for small wineries which are not able to access to the mass media.

It targets creative writers, ranging from professional journalists to amateur bloggers and recreational Twitter users, who share the synthetic speech with wider digital audiences. Personalization represents a disruptive aspect of VRITING with respect to existing speech synthesis services.

ÿ

In terms of economic impact, big news corporations companies try today various forms of monetizing their information channels, e.g. premium content, advertising, etc. In parallel, new digital communicators reach larger audiences measured in number of followers. These audiences need to access written content from a myriad of smart devices in informal and mobile situations. By using the VRITING platform, our customers will benefit of a powerful way to distribute their content adapted to these audiences.

ÿ

The scope of VRITING is global and multilingual, which confirms the ambition of building a solid and long-standing business. Moreover our business model can be scaled in the future by targeting also general audiences by promoting a more recreational and artistic usages.

ÿ

Commercial speech synthesis systems are still today only found in reduced contexts and devices, which embed a reduced set of prototypical voices by studio voice talents. One reason of its limited acceptance can be due to the lack of familiarity of current synthetic voices.

ÿ

Our approach is inspired by the idea that users will empathize with voices that sound familiar. It has the potential to increase the acceptance of synthetic voices if they resemble real people they know. It represents a relevant novelty, even at the cost of losing overall synthesis quality caused by non-professional recordings in the preparation stage.

ÿ

VRITING?s approach is disruptive in allowing any creative user to build his own personalized speech synthesizer and share his voiced writings in social media.

ÿ

In terms of technology, probabilistic models of speech such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) offer a good compromise between the required training data, computation time, personalization and intelligibility. Our framework will be based on existing statistical-based synthesis algorithms on top of our patented Kaleivoicecope technology for the audio rendering step.

ÿ

In terms of the platform architecture, we define three modules: 1) a Voice Recording App (records user voice excerpts); 2) Voice Model Creator Service (cloud-based online personalized model training); and 3) Synthesis Service (cloud-based online text-to-speech synthesis). Interoperability is managed by means of RESTful APIs, and dedicated cloud computing resources for the web services.

ÿ

Privacy issues are very important when dealing with human voice content. Although with today state-of-the-art a synthetic voice will be hardly confused with a real human voice recording, it is very important to establish mechanism to protect users privacy. VRITING needs a robust permission policy to control how users authenticate to convert written content to synthetic speech recordings. ÿThere are specific FIWARE enablers that satisfy this demand.

ÿ

Scalability is also a crucial aspect in VRITING. The process of creating a personalized voice synthesizer for one user is computationally intensive. It requires both storage capacities for audio recordings, as well as processing power to run the algorithms. FIWARE Lab cloud computing services will facilitate and leverage the potential of VRITING.

Considering that things elemental to travel are also elemental to gamification, it is easy imagine a challenging game where the goal is discover more, travel more, learn more, fixing what we learned through an emotional connection. Travelers like keeping scores: like how many countries they?ve visited and how many miles they?ve flown. Some love to accumulate badges, like stamps on their passport or even stickers on their luggage. 

ÿ

Why do we travel and explore? It?s all about creating memories, learn and discovering ourselves and the world. We believe that Gamification is perfectly aligned with that.ÿ




ÿ

At GeoGaming, we design and develop educational mobile games using Augmented Reality, Geolocation and interactive technologies to discover History and Culture through fun, interactive, and social gaming experiences.

Perpetua de Mogoda, Spain",Consumer health/wellness,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Meritxell  Gimeno,"Apollo eHealth aims to encourage citizens to practise exercise among public sport areas on the cities. Cities represent 85% of European PIB and the 75% of population. Both key factors for the economical growth.

ÿ

From childs to eldery people, Apollo eHealth ecosystem wants to track the sport activities that they do using smart sensors and IoT devices added to the already existent public furnishment and sport
machines. The autonomous and maintenance free smart sensors will report the information to the cloud, enabling other users to make games and applications to motivate people to practice sports
as well as promoting the use of public areas and increasing the social relationship.

ÿ

Apolo eHealth is a global platform implemented with IoT technology. It is a network of smart sensors that collect data about the activity performed on public sport machines already installed in public areas. It is a solution that promotes health through the sport practice expanding the possibilities of the current public areas in the cities.

ÿ

The solution focuses on health, sport and technology in order to provide a way to increase social relationships and the use of public areas by the citizens.

ÿ

The current sport machines installed on public areas are specific designed to promote the phisical activity to people. Apollo eHealth provides the collection of data thanks to a number of smart sensors installed on the machines. These information from the smart sensors could be used to make games or applications that promotes and encourage the activities to individual people and groups. The idea is to made games with objectives in order to do the exercises more funny and attractive.

ÿ

This solution solves the problematic of the activities tracking of people by doctors enabling a centralized system where the doctors can see the evolution or the activity of their patients.

ÿ

According to the data on some studies seniors believe that using machine sports on public areas of the cities contributes to their perceptions of promoting health by providing not only physical but also social and psychological profit.

ÿ

Apollo eHealth takes de advantage of public areas already equipped with some furnitures oriented to sport practice. These spaces are already available to the citizens and we extend the usability creating an ecosystems of smart sensors that collect data about the exercises. All that information
is sent to the cloud in a transparent way to the user. This is an important point due to one of the target group are seniors and the usability must be simple.

ÿ

Apollo eHealth promote healthy activities at the same time that encourage people to assume challenges. It is innovative the creation of a centralized source of data about the public spaces utilization in a totally transparent way to the user.

There is no any other global system that collect this kind of data. The smart sensors of Apollo eHealth ecosystem will be integrated with existing public machines that we can find nowdays in public areas of cities around the world. This is integration is simple and do not require complicated installations and even there is not needed any wired power supply. The smart sensors are completely autonomous and maintenance free. By using the enablers of FIWARE the smart sensors ecosystem can collect the activity data to the
cloud and third party applications can be developed promoting social relationships in the near future smart cities.

ÿ

We believe that Apollo eHealth ecosystem is an innovative idea and a completely new approach proposal for public areas helps the goverments and the public health servicies to get closer to citizens.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

ÿ

1) Introduction

The CustomAvatars project aims to create an API, server-side programs and content creation tools to help in the creation of visually cutting edge on-line 3D avatars to be embeded in any kind of online app. In the years of development experience of our team we have developed 3D character systems for console and PC on-line games, as well as 2D avatars for web-based games. The technological advances in server processing power, network bandwidth and mobile devices power has opened the possibility of having high quality 3D models embeded in any application currently using classic plain 2D avatars.

We propose the development of the set of tools and services to make this possible, easy and affordable for any project:

an API for the client software to easily embed customisable 3D models as an interactive widget in its user interface.
	a set of tools for the creation of the customisable models, using standard open formats as input.
	an efficient server that can be ran as a service implementing the API.
	a set of examples including source data models, simple client programs and their documentation.
The product will be built on top of our character customisation technology that will be relicensed with an open compatible license. This technology has been proven by games on mobile and high end platforms and you can see an overview in the video at https://www.dropbox.com/s/hjpwluycuy9v1ot/Mutable.mp4?dl=0ÿ.

ÿ

2) Use case

Let's say a company is developing a web-based or mobile application which let's users have a custom profile visible to other users in their interactions. They want to promote the emotional attachment of the user to its image in their system so they want the user to be able to customise their avatar. The steps they can follow to do this are:

- They create 3D models for the different customization options they want to offer to the user, in any tool exporting to standard formats.

- With our tool pipeline they can put together all this data defining the customization effects including mesh merge, morphs, colour effects, lighting, etc.

- After that they can run our server that will provide an API to generate per-user 3D models and provide them to the company X application.ÿ

- They can use our example 3D viewers in their web application or mobile phones or develop their own systems to show the 3D model and offer the avatar customisation interface to the user.

The service of hosting the custom avatar server can be provided by an external company, or by X themselves since all technology will be available.

We will also offer artwork creation services and avatar creation advice, so that any company that doesn't have the required skillset can still use this system.

ÿ

3) Marketing strategy

The marketing strategy will consist of 2 phases: the first one will aim to getting one or two projects that embrace this technology and demonstrate its use and quality. The second stage will be to broaden the promotion of the system by using the applications in the first phase as flagship products. The marketing channels will be on-line promotion and specialise web-application conference presentations.ÿWe will be flexible on filling the gaps that the customers may have in the system pipeline: artwork creation, service execution, or end-user application development support.

ÿ

4) Competitors

This kind of systems for 3D avatars at the level of quality we will be providing have so far only been available in high-end consoles like Xbox Live, or Nintendo Mii, which cannot interoperate wor be reused outside of their closed ecosystem.

ÿ

We believe it is time web applications reach console games quality regarding avatar customization!",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

This made us decide to put our tech knowledge at the service of those needs.

ÿ

We have found that there is a lack of specialised, easy-to-use, online tools for people who work in contemporary art (or have jobs related related to it). This realisation came to us by our experience in our art practice and then reinforced by working and interviewing various artists and cultural managers.

ÿ

Tan-T n looks to fill that void by creating a platform where people in the art industry ?one of the most redituable creative economies on the global market? can work individually or in collaboration, communicate more efficiently, manage and show their work and create new dynamics, networks and projects for Europe and the rest of the world.

ÿ

This will be achieved by providing specialised tools for the different types of users in this industry: artists, curators, collectors, gallerists, private or public art-spaces/institutions and the general public; unlike other platforms, we will not only focus in the well-known artists and institutions, we intend to gather emerging artists, non-institutional art spaces and freelance creatives.

ÿ

Through the creation and usage of Tan-T n we will be building the organic and up-to-date database of the art-field. One that will help curators and institutions to find information about trends, relations between artists, cross-references among their work and key events in the art world in an specific time and space.

It will also give answers to questions like ?who is participating in this creative industry??, ?what do they do??, ?where do they live??; answers that can help researchers and EU institutions ?such as cultural ministries? to get a better knowledge of the industry, it?s people and needs, and act accordingly.

ÿ

On the tech front, the platform consists on a web-based application and a series of mobile apps that will take into account two key factors in the art-field: mobility and personalisation. Tan-T n will provide the user with access to the information within the platform from multiple locations and devices such as mobile phones or tablets through apps that will behave intelligently according to the user?s profile and field of work.

We are aware that art-making has surrounding activities that are not necessarily tech-related. On that front, the Tan-T n will also offer a series of community-related and seminars and gathering to provide non-technical tools such as craft tips, networking and a knowledge base about day-to-day tasks (e.g. how to hand out an invoice?).

Tan-T n has the potential to become the de-facto toolbox for the art industry and their needs. This translates into a global, very ambitious and complex project that will process massive amounts of data generated by end-user interaction both in the virtual and tangible world. ÿThis is where FI-ware comes into place as the provider of the technologies ?namely the ones in the Data/Context Management Architecture chapter? that will help us to achieve the needs of the enterprise.",Tech provider,,0,0,X,0,0,,Software,Content management,Applications,Content Applications,1,0,0,Startup,50000,tantan.ly

On the one hand it is addressed at an audience that needs fashion advice: how to combine clothes; the App will recommend what to wear using information about the city on weather conditions in real-time and shops where clothes are sold. It will also interact with personal shoppers and influential people in the world of fashion via the community that will be created to receive precise advice on how to be fashionable on any occasion. On the other hand, it would be related with giving information in real-time on fashion events organized in the city. That community will also make it possible for fashion creators, bloggers, personal-shoppers, designers? to co-create through an exchange of ideas, patterns, new designs, and where the general public may also give their opinion. This means that young designers will be able to present their designs to a large community, improve them and even market them.

The use of innovative games related with the world of fashion will be fundamental to involve people and also generate traffic towards shops participating in the community or services that offer personal shoppers, stylists, etc.

It expands creative environments allowing to combine sound and lights with a single multimedia nodule very easy to use: it can be programmed from the computer or from a smartphone to customize its features.

ÿ

monodo allows both individual and combined network use, creating more complex lighting and sound architectures. Connected to the Internet, it serves as a remote communication system between creators, or between the creator and his audience, with a great sound quality.

ÿ

monodo fits in a pocket, it is cheap and it is also compatible with traditional light and sound connectors for creation (Jack Audio IN &amp; OUT, DMX) and the usual internet connections. monodo saves time and money to the creator: with it, he is able to control sound and light without mixers, or technical specialists, without the assembly and transportation high costs? monodo also facilitates the implementation of performances without the need of having control elements hidden or endless wiring. This fact allows the creator to perform almost anywhere, like spaces ÿnot prepared for complex lighting systems (the street, for example), or small unusual spaces (chapels), areas of special protection (historic buildings), singular architectures (classical symphonic spaces)...

ÿ

His physical strength and technical stability gives durability, and its flexibility allows the use of potential complementary gadgets (special led lamps, batteries for monodo, amplifiers, specific software, sensors...), new improved versions (monodo for interactive, for visual, ...) and even new application environments such as artistic distance education or health creative therapies, for example. ÿÿ

ÿ

monodo generates community by opening its code and by boosting forums where users will have the freedom to download, to run, to copy, to distribute, to share, to change and to improve their software for any purpose without paying licensing fees.

monodo revolutionizes the scene making it accessible to everyone.

ÿ

The business plan of monodo project is therefore based on the technical simplification of the processes of creation and exhibition, and in expanding the expressive possibilities of different performing art practices such as contemporary music, classical music, theater, dance, performance. This technology is created for both amateurs and professional people, and both adults and children. Monodo will be available anywhere on the globe.

ÿ

Potential customers are people who practice music, theater, dance and performance occasionally or regularly, also for stage professionals, educators and students. Thanks to its ease of use and its compatibility with traditional sound and lighting systems, monodo can be used by anyone easily and can be combined with their old systems.

monodo saves money and improves the creative experience, presenting a technological innovation that will change the day-to-day relationships in the process of the artistic expression. Like the iPod at its time, which facilitated the access to culture for everyone, monodo will contribute to increase creativity relations, allowing easier and simpler expression systems.

In this project we will create the first prototype of Timepath Online. To do so, we willÿintegrate the core tools of Timepath with the CREATIFI Technologies. Timepath Online will be an online service helping creators of immersive virtual reality experiences to create content easily, publish it, and share it with content consumers.

ÿ

Currently, the Timepath experience is delivered with local standalone software. We will take advantage of the CREATIFI tools to transform this into an online experience, where multiple virtual reality consumers will be able to share a common Timepath experience, feeling part of a story plot rendered within an interactive virtual reality.ÿ

ÿ

ÿOn the content creators side, content creators will be able to use the Timepath production tools. The Timepathÿproduction pipeline leverage the expertise of a small theatre crew ÿtoÿdeliver a story rendered by smart interactive virtual characters within immersive virtual reality. The process of creating content is adapted from cinema and theatre: write a script, stage it with actors, and edit it through a standalone software with a graphical user interface. However, the result is not a video, but rather an immersive virtual reality where the end-user can become his favorite character by acting accordingly, and change one or another part of the plot, as a consequence of his actions. Alternatively, he can also adopt a more passive attitude and see how the story unfolds, with all the story roles adopted by different autonomous virtual characters. We call this the Timepath experience.

ÿ

Beyond this prototype stage, complementary services will also be available at Timepath online. Examples of such services can be the automated rigging of the virtual characters, the access to pre-implemented artificial intelligence modules taking care of commonly needed interactive functionality, or the analysis of the end-users reactions and preferences.ÿÿTo deliver these services the CREATIFI cloud infrastructure will be used for data storage and online behavioral analyses of the actions and reactions of the end-users.

ÿ

On the consumers side, Timepath online will be a website powered by a set of CREATIFI-enabled online services. It will be used to purchase, access and experience Virtual Reality experiences at home, as well as share them.ÿ

The project was initally developed as part of a research for the future of education, allowing any user (kids or adults) to create behaviors for arduino based robots using simplified behavior tree paradigms. Behavior tree paradigms work differently from standard linear programming. It is often used in game development to construct behaviors for non player characters and can also be used to trigger multimedia content events (show images, play videos, expect triggers).

ÿ

With an early prototype we have done usability tests in a workshop environment to young kids to determine the usability of the editor comparing it to other robot behavior editors (lego mindstorms) and have obtained good results indicating that our tool is more intuitive for organizing robot behaviors.

DatAWARE is a system that will be applied into specialised tools for specific thematics. For example, Quepo will use DatAWARE to create Hunger DATA, a refference tool that will allow users to extract fundamental analysis on the topic of the right to nourishment in the world.

ÿ

Increasingly, in our society there is a demand for issues related to prevention and antiaging. It is an increasing market. Many people go to alternative medicine and other methods of knowledge to know the state of their body and how to prevent diseases, as well as retard body?s oxidation, due to the passing of time and exposure to external contaminated agents.

In the US there is a big industry in preventative medicine, since there is no social security and people have to resort to supplements, micronutrients, microcosmethics, etc.

There are several techniques that prevent and inform us about the state of our body and what it needs to improve in all aspects.

One of these techniques is electroacupuncture of Voll (EAV), it is one of the most recognized and used by practitioners of integrative medicine methods. It is a diagnostic method that combines elements from disciplines such as Chinese acupuncture, homeopathy, conventional medicine and orthomolecular medicine.

ÿ

WHAT IT CONSISTS OF?

ÿ

Electroacupuncture of Voll involves measurement of the electrical resistance of certain points on the skin by means of an electrode or catheter. These points are called acupuncture meridians described by ancient Chinese doctors and are reflected in located specific points of the hands and feet.

Each of these points, also used in other therapies such as reflexology, connect directly to an organ or body part. Whereupon electroacupuncture can diagnose all kinds of ailments and diseases and see what we have materially affected, or what works for poor performance in our body.

Currently on the market there is an applicance called Kindling EAV-2000s, which is headed by the range of electroacupuncture devices.

The applicance contains a tool where you can see the measurements and a catheter which is what connects the patient to the meter.

ÿ

ÿ

ÿ

PROPOSAL

ÿ

The project idea isÿ a Fiware that processes data in real time. It is an adaptation of electroacupuncture of Voll machine, without being exactly the same, but works similarly. It is exactly an application that can be downloaded on a tablet, mobile phone or a computer.

This application requires a wireless external device, a measuring electrode and a third element that connects the user with the catheter and the application to make the circle system process the information.

Through our device (eg tablet) the application is entered and we can check if we have a part of the body or organ that is malfunctioning.

How do we do it? Through the catheter and the acupuncture points that are given to us through the screen of the device (mobile, tablet or computer), we state what we want.

Example: We are interested in knowing the state of our liver. The user enters into the application. Once inside, when the liver is selected, a screen immediately tells the acupuncture point, the foot or hand, you have to press the catheter to determine the state of your liver. A GO screen is activated! In which the user can press with the acupuncture point catheter. Immediately after knowing the state of the liver the meter does the same, EAV-Kindling is displayed. Through a mobile graph, we see the liver. If the values are below 50%, the liver is not in an optimal condition. Then, the application will give a series of recommendations to improve the state of this organ, indicating to the user the practice of sport, leaving no harmful substance to the liver, herbs, micronutrients, nutrition, etc.

It is an application that allows the user to have at his fingertips an analysis to determine the state which his body is in and what things can be done to improve its condition.

It is a tool for prevention and antiaging, where you can see through the different acupuncture points on the body condition, you can know the skin condition, through any organ or sense. Only an external device has to be connected via Bluetooth to the device where you have downloaded the application which is needed.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

Darelist is a geosocial challenge-discovery networking app that helps you to challenge your friends or simply to challenge yourself for fun or for a great cause such as ?shoot 6 second video while drinking X at Y? or ?show how brave you are by taking selfie while donating blood at Y? so that you give yourself and your friends reasons to move away from the routines, to discover around, to enjoy new experiences and even to be part of something remarkable and unique.

It is like our childhood game ?I dare you? meets ?Foursquare? meets ?Twitter?.

Darelist lets you be social, challenge yourself and get out from your routines. With Darelist, you can easily see the challenges on map, go and complete them or dare your friends to complete. You earn Dare Points (DP) when you complete a challenge or someone you dare to complete a challenge.

Dare Points makes your profile stand out. You start with Dearie level and make your way up to Dare Devil level by earning DP ? and maybe you make a few fans (Darelinks) along the way. When you complete a challenge, your Darelinks can see your accomplishment in their flow, applaud it and even share it with their own Darelinks. With the most interesting accomplishment photos and videos, you can have lots of Darelinks and be a phenomenon on Darelist!

As you level up, you will see more challenges on your map. To make things even more interesting, high-level challenges give you more than DP ? sometimes it is a discount at a restaurant or a free drink at a bar or even something you want to be proud of to wear such as a DareBlood Bracelet.

In Darelist, there is always a challenge waiting for you! Each week, Darelist Team renews the challenges in your city. You can also suggest challenges to earn extra DP and you can earn even more if your suggestion gets included in a weekly list.

Darelist is the most fun way to inspire people to go out, discover new places and share moments with the rest of world. Darelist is the only app you will need to decide what to do next from a handpicked list crafted by the professionals.

CUSTOMER PROBLEM

People find it hard to discover new places or find activities to enjoy their time. Most of the people we reached out told that they prefer same places or activities when they go out. The main reason stated by those is that they are not able to find diversity of places or activities around for their interest. They use different apps or websites to discover restaurants, movies, theaters or simply areas. Those channels of information provide popularity-biased and outdated information and that makes it hard to discover truly new places and activities.

TARGET CUSTOMERS

The target customers are millennials. They are active social media users. They want to share whatsoever is happening around them as well as they love to learn what others are doing.

SALES&amp;MARKETING STRATEGY 

We will use unit model. We define one unit as a city. The marketing strategy will be focused on increasing the number of sales in one unit to reach the key metrics before starting marketing activities in a second unit. We are planning to start with Istanbul. We will work with popular bloggers/city explorers to create challenge lists and going to acquire first users among young professionals, university students and high school students who are active in social media, especially in Twitter.

REVENUE MODEL

Darelist will generate ad-revenue by helping businesses to find more customers by listing challenges related to them and charge only for people who really complete the challenge. Besides, Darelist will be a freemium app with in-app products such as boosters to gain more experience to climb up level ladder faster.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

The idea was conceived to support new artists and emerging creators by not selling ready-made and stock products, instead the designer will manufacture once a minimum of unit sales has been reached, enabling them to produce and deliver on demand.

ÿ

The platform, which will be accessible from the web and from its own app, will enable the buying and selling of products in many different categories, directly between the designer and client. They are decorative objects, furniture, sports, games, technology, various gadgets, etc., that the creator should be able to supply, perfectly finished and on schedule, to the buyer.

ÿ

The project permits sales directly between creator and consumers, in order to test the acceptance of a new product before mass production. This can rule out projects that are unattractive to the market, while helping more viable initiatives to grow.

ÿ

At the same time, it allows consumers to obtain exclusive items, test, share opinions and be the first to purchase products before widespread commercialization.

ÿ

The platform enables a bidirectional relationship between users by providing a product page with information managed by its creator, which will house video content, photographs and texts explaining the advantages of the article, their motivations and expectations. This web space will allow user comments and the ability to share content on social networks. Thanks to the implementation of fiware technologies, the user experience is enhanced with 3D and/or augmented reality views, and price tracking is linked to the current demand. It is an original and entertaining experience that will bring together the creators and their followers and will help accelerate the projects involved.

ÿ

Any new product that is listed for sale on the platform will have a unit price, to be determined by its creator, after analysing the cost of production, distribution and other expenses associated with the process. As a major technological innovation, the selling price will be automatically reduced according to the number of units you have purchased. The website shows the minimum number of sales required to make production viable and an updated real-time price and permanent accumulated sales counter.

ÿ

The designer will face the challenge of selling the article to as many people as possible within a time limit of 60 days. During this period, the challenge is to develop a campaign to promote their product and reach a sufficient level of purchase commitments from customers. Buyers can also participate by ?spreading the word? and their bank accounts will not be charged until the campaign is complete and has reached the desired target.

ÿ

In addition to this ""challenge"" mode, obligatory for new projects, other products may be purchased in the traditional way with a fixed price and no time limit. This will be available for products that have passed the challenge stage and whose designers wish to keep them on sale for a longer shelf life.

ÿ

Transport and logistics are provided by the platform, with the seller assuming the cost. The platform supplies the packaging with a unified branding image and supervises quality control. The manufacturing system, deadlines and prices should be well established by the time an item is offered for sale on the web. The professionals who manage the platform will be permanently available to give free advice and guidance. Other services such as creating promotional photos and videos as well as legal management for the legal protection of the product, may be contracted separately.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

Through them, business inform us on products and services we need, maps that help us to locate ourselves and reach those business, resources containing opinions from each business that allow us to make informed decisions. However, users face up with a pitfall: infoxication, i.e., the huge amount of information and the wide range of contents cause that users feel confused when looking for specific information. Furthermore, many cities have ÿlow quality resources to help in finding the leisure and business options that SMEs offer due to disperse, out-of-date or unavailable data. E.g., a misleading and incomplete list of shops in Torrevieja (Spain) is found in an official web page http://torrevieja.comercioscomunitatvalenciana.com

Advertisement information do not rid of this problem and marketing actions often do not reach the right potential customer at the right time to get a purchase action. Currently, advertising content is lost within the big amount of information and media that the potential customer must manage. Some tools such as Google AdSense (http://www.google.com/adsense/start) tries to personalize advertisement, but they usually fail in providing the right ad, to the right person at the right time and place. Therefore, advertisement becomes unuseful or, even worse, annoying.

Local SMEs need mechanisms to create and sharing multimodal content, taking advantage of the last IT in order to disseminate promotions, services and products, personalized ads, etc. These mechanisms allow customers (either a local, tourist or company) to connect up the city and all its opportunities (cultural, business and leisure) through a contextualized and multimodal advertisement. Our business idea provides these mechanisms through a multisided platform that will serve as channel for communication between final users (tourists, residents or local business) and business users (SMEs in the commercial and leisure business that want to advertise their products or services). The value propositions of our business idea for final users are as follows:


	Free search on leisure and business options in the easiest and direct way.
	
	
	Counting on action advisor (a recommender of spots that are available at the city). ÿ
	
	
	Customers get personalized information according to their preferences and their context (geolocation), as follows:

	
		Walking mode: a guided shopping in which the users start walking around and different useful ads ÿ(according to their preferences) are recommended.
		
		
		Offline mode: push messages are used for providing ad content (depending on user preferences).
		
		
		Coupon mode: users have the possibility to query active offers.
		
	
Business users will get the following value propositions:


	Targeted ads in order to specifically advertise ideal content to connect the right final users.
	
	
	Promotion by contextualization, augmented reality, geolocation, multimedia content, etc. Content will be more attractive for final user since the right content is provided at the right time and place
	
	
	Advertisement management system as a web platform that allows business users to update information, manage offers or coupons, managing leisure schedule, etc.
	
Furthermore, other market segment has been detected (related to the multisided nature of our business idea): local and traditional mass media (newspaper, magazine, road maps, etc.), since they are still used by consumers and companies. We can offer more appealing and enriched content by using augmented reality as value proposition for this segment.

ÿ

As a result of the social networks revolution of the past few years, users can now find applications focused to create and share almost all kind of contents.

Over time, ProtoPixel strengthened its expertise towards Interactive Lighting Design (ILD), an emergent field that combines lighting engineering and interaction design with the aim of creating expressive and dynamic media content for luminic surfaces. In a way, it is all about manipulating and controlling light in a creative manner, as something more than switching bulbs on and off. 

ÿ

Through an extended ILD practice, ProtoPixel developed a deep expertise in different aspects of ILD services, and became deeply aware of the needs that currently affect the field, as the lack of prototyping tools, the need of frameworks for content and interface development, cross-platforms solutions, compatibility with current industrial standards, among others.

ÿ

Fed by this industrial experience, Protopixel has started to develop ProtoLight, a product that will bridge the current creative and engineering gaps that exist between lighting and interaction design. In short, ProtoLight is a plug &amp; play hardware and software framework that allows to create any type of lighting surface (from large scale media facades to wearable displays) out of most commercially available luminic artifacts (i.e. LEDs strips) and display media content that can be controlled in real time by different input methods, from mobile phones, to motion and wearable sensors, cameras, data from the internet, etc. With ProtoLight, designers can create highly expressive content without the need of learning specific programming skills, but at the same time, ILD engineers and developers will also find it compatible with current technical standards, which makes ProtoLight a perfect fit for existing ILD setting. ÿÿÿÿ

ÿ

ProtoLight has been conceived as an interaction and design-driven tool for ILD practitioners, offering affordable and scalable solutions for creating interactive lighting environments, according to the following guidelines:

ÿ

- Multiplatform and compatible with current mobile (Android and iOS) and industrial standards (i.e. DMX, artnet, OPC, siphon)

ÿ

- Protocol for setting up and controlling LEDs structures in non-regular surfaces using standard network infrastructure.

ÿ

- Low floor, high ceiling: a tool suitable for both professional practitioners (i.e designers and developers) and Maker communities for developing an ecosystem based on current open standards such as Arduino and FadeCandy.

ÿ

- Graphic User Interface for content creation and visualization. 

ÿ

- Automatic surface calibration and real time simulation of lighting structures.

ÿ

- Compatible with 3rd party application and plug-ins support.

ÿ

- Fast communication with chained LED structures via wired and wireless network protocols.

ÿ

- Seamless access to different sensors and online data such as social networks, big databases, etc.

ÿ

- Mobile app for in-place design, control and perspective correction for any LED scenario. (protolight software for mobile devices)


ProtoLight will take media content beyond traditional screens,making possible to create media facades and ephemeral luminic structures that can be seamlessly connected to the different sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) to foster expressive interaction, public visualizations and social awareness, among others. ÿ",Tech provider,,0,0,X,0,X,,Hardware,Mechanical Computer-Aided Design,Applications,Engineering Applications,1,0,0,"SME, Startup",50000,protopixel.net

CS&amp;CS gets integrated to the main social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, LinkedIn, Google Plus and Slideshare) and generates personalized online advertising and promotion campaigns ÿ

ÿ

CS&amp;CS provides two main functionalities. On the one hand, ÿthe creation of graphical material for promotion and, on the other hand, the launch and management ÿof campaigns simultaneously in different ÿonline social networks based on the created graphical material.

ÿ

CS&amp;CS will support the creation of different materials according the social network where it will be published:

Facebook: ÿstatic images, banners, logos, animations, static content
	Google Plus: static images, banners, logos, animations, static content
	Twitter: static images that will be hosted in the cloud and that will be linked in Twitter.
	Flickr static images that can be shared
	LinkedIn static images, banners, logos and animations
	Slideshare: ÿpresentations.
Once the graphical material is created, it can be used to be part of a promotional campaign. It can be chosen for its publication in different social media with an optional text joining it (constrains in text, such as number of characters, or format, will depend on the social networks constrains and will be reflected by CS&amp;CS). Preview features will be available so promotional messages can be shown in the way that the social networks will publish them allowing its modification before publication.

Promotional campaigns can be created consolidating different promotional materials. CS&amp;CS provides community management capabilities for the management and following up of ÿthe promotional campaigns in social networks in a centralized place by providing a centralized place where comments can be read and replied.

CS&amp;CS is targeted to SMEs without enough economical resources for a dedicated Community manager for Social Media Optimization, neither for a dedicated human resource for creative generation of banners or publicity

ÿ

CS&amp;CS will follow a SaaS distribution model. It will be hosted on the cloud and will be offered as a service with a monthly fee that most SMEs will be able to afford. Clients will be able to try the service freely for a month before they make the decision of hiring the service. A monthly fee of 150 ? is being initially considered but it has to be tested properly with a market prospection.

ÿ

This distribution model will allow an easy process of internationalization. By translating the service to the languages of the target countries the services would be able to be hired globally.

ÿ

An initial analysis of the target market will be made where the sectors of the target SMEs will be identified with an initial focus on retailers SMEs.

The marketing strategy will be based on online advertisement using Google AdWords and ads on specialized webs. Hiring by Internet will be encouraged. A sales force providing support when needed will be also available.

ÿ

The competitors of CS&amp;CS would be the professional community managers and the SW applications for banners generation.

Our mission is to help cultural and educative organizations to spread their knowledge and legacy through different digital channels. We feature the world?s leading museums, monuments and art fairs, all in one place. More than 25% of the visits in Museums are students or school groups and often the way that Cultural institutions approach them doesn't fit their reality, since the returning rate among teenagers is lower than 3%. Audioguides or guided tours are not enough to understand the complexity of the legacy exposed in these cultural organizations. The channel that millenniums are using is based on their smartphones and tablets, that's why culture needs to start approaching them in this way.

ÿ

As a solution, CloudGuide offers a universal app and a platform for museums and art galleries, allowing them to communicate their heritage through multimedia guides. The CloudGuide appÿ already exists, but now we are aiming to develop the spin-off app called CloudGuide Education, just focused on the educative environment. The development itself would not be complicated, since CloudGuide Education maintains the same structure as its ""mother"" but with a completely new input of features specialized for this target. Moreover, the company has an already existing museum network willing to test it.ÿ This way we unite all the content of the museums around the world with the focus on interactivity and quizzes for the youngest.

ÿ

CloudGuide and CloudGuide Education will be a perfect complement for visitors (specially families), schools and cultural institution. With CloudGuide Education, Museums Education Department's will get an access to the platform allowing them to start creating multimedia and interactive guides without any investment. The traditional CloudGuide system supports audio, video, additional text, links, suggested routes, etc, but now with the new Education project they will get the possibility to transform this content into play&amp;learn games/quizzes, social conversations and introduce interactive objects. Moreover, museums can examine all the related statistics gathered through our app.

ÿ

Students, school groups and people with special needs will no longer have to carry around the old-fashioned unhygienic audioguide or download multiple apps per museum.

ÿ

We are pleased to introduce Geointereactiva: an interactive platform which offers cartographic and geographic content tools, meant to serve teachers and students in the learning experience.

ÿ

Geointeractiva's main product, the digital map canvas, is based on information and communication technologies (ICT) for education. Through an on-line subscription fee Geointeractiva provides content and map tools for schools and universities of any level.

ÿ

Learning with Geointeractiva as in a new paradigm of ICT education, enhances the experience that students and teachers get from their ""Ed-Tech"" tools: Digital Boards (IDB), laptops and tablets &amp; smartphones.

ÿ

The maps are a 100% native ones, meaning that our designers and cartographers team designs and vectorizes the maps starting from zero to achieve a full interactive teaching/learning tool.

ÿ

Geointeractiva's maps are built up on our own design criteriaÿ we provide design and cartography within a conceptual and educational interface of software and data content. That means the main aesthetic difference with other map app's (as may be Google Maps).

ÿ

The cartographic base of each map is structured in two parts: planimetry and toponymy. The content of the Interactive resource is easy to use, smooth, friendly and intuitive, and is permanently updated in real time. Maps are available in different idiomatic versions.ÿ

ÿ

The Geointeractiva's user can enable or disable thematic layers on the maps of different thematic topics like demography, economy, etc. allowing him to compare the statistical data among diverse territories (countries, regions, municipalities, etc.).

ÿ

Geointeractiva allows students to customize their own maps and build up their own charts. And if the student or teacher wants to share what they have customize, Geointeractiva allows them to share and edit (if accepted) their maps and charts. Geointeractiva's digital map canvas are available to be synchronized (on-line &amp; on-land). Customization and sync. enhances both, the educator'sÿ lecture and the students learning experience.

ÿ

Students can interact not only by reading and learning the contents on the screen (referring to an old fashion way of learning) but also doing the proposed exercises and activities which are meant to enhance the student's creativity and own learning criteria (his own hermeneutic learning system).",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

The documentary is a portrait of Baix Llobregat, the region surrounding Barcelona city, one of the most build up areas in Catalonia, that at the same time is the green lung of the city. This is the area with more density of infraestructures in the whole country (railways, motorways, port, airport?) but it?s also an important agricultural space that produces 15% of the vegetables consumed in Barcelona every day. Surprisingly, people from the city don?t know the key environmental role that this area plays in their daily life. The farmers from the zone live in a struggle to preserve their properties as agricultural land, and to communicate to the Barcelona?s citizens that they are important food producers, with a key role in terms of ÿthe city resilience to the 21st Century challenges. Meanwhile the real estate speculators treat to develop their housing an industrial plans in the zone. The scientists and technicians studying the zone, defend that Barcelona should stop considering this zonethe city?s backyard. ?ORGULL DE BAIX? is a platform designed to help to provoke this change, by highlighting the environmental values of the zone, empowering its population, and creating links between them and the inhabitants of Barcelona city. ÿ The mission of the project is to amplify the documentary impact by creating an online permanent space that will become a useful resource for the community living in that area, for the farmers, for the consumers living in the Barcelona city area, and for the researchers studying urban landscape architecture, future city developments, infrastructure plans, and environmental studies. ÿ We will produce the non linear documentary version of ?The Backyard? that will be hosted in the website ?ORGULL DE BAIX?. In the forefront of the website there will be the interactive documentary playing, while in the background the user will have access to an interactive map of the region that will allow them to navigate and discover the environmental richness of the zone. We will use the interactive map to display 3 minute video pieces on the different farms of the area. Through the navigation and this video-information, the user will have a clear picture on the agricultural production of the region (the type of vegetables, the farmers, their farming methods). Other icons in the interactive map will provide information about the farmers? markets available in the zone, leisure rutes for bird watching and other natural resources. ÿÿÿ For the launching of the web documentary the interactive map will be published with a small number of ÿvideo pieces portraying the farms of the region.

?Road to the Nasrid World? is the first element ofÿ?ALHAMBRA?S BUILDERS?, an ambitious transmedia documentary project that wants to break down barriers between culture and entertainment by producing a whole cultural experience mixing different technological platforms developments with real live events, to create an ecosystem in which the audience would experiment a journey to discover the history behind one of the most iconic buildings of Al-Andalus. ÿÿÿÿÿ

ÿ

ALHAMBRA?S BUILDERS: ROAD TO THE NASRID WORLD

Alhambra?s Builders is a project about men and women who planned, built and lived the most famous monument from Al-Andalus. ÿ

The Alhambra, the most visited monument of Spain, is one of the most beautiful buildings on the earth. It is very well known, but in a static way. We want to bring life to these beautiful walls, discover who built them, how and why they created it.

And at the same time, to deepen our knowledge of the whole conception of life of the Granada kingdom and the Nasrid society, in order to highlight the extraordinary value of this period in history when Islamic culture was a synonym for science, poetry, knowledge and innovation.

This will be the portrait of a forgotten and transcendent chapter of European history, the Silicon Valley of the XIII-XIV Century, the most innovative and advanced civilization of its time, making significant contributions in Mathematics, Engineering, Agriculture and Arts that had a lasting impact on our culture and will continue to do so for generations to come. And the construction of the Alhambra palaces, as a materialization of this intellectual power and sophistication.

ÿ

We will produce a produce a whole cultural and entertaining experience building a story universe that will develop through different technological platforms. The project is to create a big hub which will include a data visualization tool, a videogame, a mobile and tablet touristic app for visitors of the monument, a mobile and tablet app for kids, a book, a web documentary and a feature documentary. Each piece of the project will have its independent partnership structure and financial plan and funds.

ROAD TO THE NAZRI WORLD is the title of the data visualization tool, which is the first part of the project. The idea is to develop a data visualization tool over the online archive of the Alhambra (or over Europeana, if the Alhambra online archive can connect with Europeana -these conversations are open-) to facilitate the access to this big source of archive material, creating an attractive, meaningful and playful interface.

We will use this tool to:

- launch the project to public and create a first impact.

- connect with the first target group of audience (historians studying Al-Andalus and and their research teams), and to create engagement between them and the project, inviting them to help the writers team to find out the most interesting sources of information.

- facilitate the research process.

- make the research process of the creative team (documentarists, screenwriters) visible and more transparent.

- encourage historians to share their work.

ÿ

The mission of this development is to start building a community around the project, which will be at the same time our first engaged audience, active collaborators and curators. While we start the classic documentation and research process of an historical documentary scriptwriting, we build a public tool that creates an attractive path to the data on this subject. This will help historians to make their search work easier and that at the same, thanks to its playful and user friendly interface, will help visualize their work among a wider type of users. ÿÿÿ

The project has the support of the Patronato de la Alhambra y el Generalife, and the interest of Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

MultiDub, synchronous multilingual dubbing in movie theaters.

ÿ

MultiDub is a smartphone app that allows cinema spectators to watch the movie being projected on the screen in the language of their choice. The procedure is simple: with a pair of earphones, the user enters the cinema and when the film begins, by just a single tap, the smartphone records a snippet of the ambient sound (i.e. from the loudspeakers). Technically, after this, MultiDub analyzes the spectral contents of the snippet and extracts a set of unique features that are transmitted to a remote server that will identify the film and the time position that corresponds to the moment when the fragment of audio was captured. This way, it is possible for the server to let the user know which languages are available. Next, the user chooses the language and the server provides him/her with the corresponding streaming audio. Then, MultiDub outputs it at the client-side by seamlessly synchronizing the sound with the images in motion that are projected on the cinema screen. Actually, and as one of our main unique selling propositions, the user still benefits from the acoustic conditions of the hall, without noticing the interference of the original dubbing emanating from the surrounding loudspeakers. This is carried out thanks to the support for specific digital processing techniques that allows MultiDub to combine the sound effects of the movie (only music and other effects from the ambient audio) with the dubbed conversations that are sent to MultiDub, while minimizing the interference due to the voices of the ambient sound. This way, the user transparently senses the audio as though he was not listening to any earphone, while profiting from the special acoustic conditions of the hall.

ÿ

As of MultiDub?s target market, Spainis one of the most powerful tourism economies in the world, receiving each year around 80 million foreign (non-Spanish-speaking) visitors who cannot have any access to movie theaters because of their limited knowledge of Spanish. Actually, only 1% of all cinemas in Spainprovide films in original version. Moreover, an increasing number of Spanish-speaking individuals prefer to watch multimedia contents in original version, due mainly to the richness and subtleties of real cast dialogues. As an archetypical MultiDub user, we can relate our target customer to the profile of a foreign tourist that does not speak the language of the movie. Around 30/40 years old, British nationality, single or married. In Spainfor holidays (non-resident) or for retirement (resident). She/he likes to attend cultural activities and loves watching movies. Note: the British community represents the third major group of resident foreigners after Rumanians and Moroccans, and the first non-resident foreign tourist segment.

ÿ

According to our Business Model, MultiDub makes money by relaying on micro-payments and advertising. The central product is the ?Dubble?, i.e. a packet of alternative dubbings that the user downloads to the mobile platform in order to enjoy the film according to his/her preferences. A user can have access to Dubbles according to two different modes: (1) By micro-paying for each Dubble directly (better sound quality, no advertisement, etc.), i.e. Dubble HiFi, and (2) Free (with sporadic ads supported commercially by a unit of advertising content, called ?DubAd?), i.e. Dubble Free. The advertisements that support Dubble Free financially correspond to the DubAd product, which can be described as a unit of advertising content offered to individuals or corporations.",Service Provider,,0,0,X,0,0,,Software,"Content Analytics, Discovery, and Cognitive Software",Applications,Content Applications,1,0,0,Startup,50000,multidub.com

During the last decades, the way customers obtain technological assistance has remained the same. Usually, if a customer has a question or problem related to a technology-oriented purchase, the only way to receive support is by calling the manufacturer, usually a call-center, or send an e-mail. It's very usual to find a scenario in which the buyer has to explain the problem multiple times to multiple agent, with long waiting times and a completely traditional setup (landline phone, e-mail or postal letter). We strongly feel that both sides, customer and company, could benefit enormously if the support experience was reinvented with the new technologies in mind, that is, by using unexplored channels such as support apps, interactive support websites and multi-platform solutions for connecting the companies and the customers.

We are focusing in two different markets. The first of them is the domestic market, in which we use the brand ClipCare. In this market, we focus in offering flat-rate, recurring subscriptions for obtaining multi-platform tech support. There is a very wide percentage of the society which, despite not being digital natives, have to use computers, tablets and other technological devices on a daily basis to perform their work, to communicate with they loved ones or to develop their daily tasks. It's very frequent for those people to have questions or problems related to the use of those devices and software, which are not covered by the manufacturer. In this context, the only way to obtain assistance is to auto-solve the problems or refer to a friend or family member who has a wider knowledge of that topic. The auto-solving is usually not a option because it requires ability to find understand technological workarounds which may not exactly fit the device, software version or environment used by the customer, who is not a digital native. Every ClipCare subscriber has an assigned agent, which can be contacted using any of our applications available for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and standalone website. Those websites provide chat-style support and VoIP calling in an extremely intuitive manner.

The second area in which we are present is the enterprise market. We are offering, under the SocialEdge brand, a standalone version of our customer-to-company engagement technologies, especially suited to redefine the after sales experience, but also able to manage internal issue tracking.ÿ

Our technologies are in an advanced stage of development, including functional prototypes of all the applications and web technologies, as well as beta versions for early-adopters.

304,CREA304,CREA,CREAtiFi,Portugal,IPCA,Vead - Feel it! Share it!,"Rua Fialho de Almeida,  N31, 2esquerdo, 4700-123 Braga, Portugal",Consumer health/wellness,0,#N/A,#N/A,NO,0,Pedro Rodrigues,"Vead is a high-tech wearable band containing a set of vibration units that are able to provide a handful of sensations to its user, according to the particular media content being watched, namely movies, music, digital games and mobile apps.

In a world where the vast majority of devices rely only on video and audio to provide feedback to users, Vead is a game-changer solution that opens an entirely new interaction dimension to the ever increasing markets of apps, digital games, and media content.

Vead comprises a high-level API which can be easily used by third-party developers to control the actuation of different vibration patterns directly to one or several body parts of its user, such as head, chest, arms and legs. ÿThe device integrates several vibration modules and one main processing unit capable of gathering the 3D device orientation, generate vibration patterns and transmit data through Bluetooth 4.0. In addition, Vead is also able of monitoring biological information such as heart rate, temperature and sweat level.

The most important success element of the entire entertainment industry relies on its ability to deliver sensations and emotions to its public, being it through music, movies, tv series, digital games or apps. People turn to this type of content in an expectation for truly deep and novel emotions, and the better the content is in providing such experience to users, the most impact and demand it will create in audiences. Vead focus exactly on the enhancement of emotions and sensations provided by entertainment content, thus providing a strong contribution to the impact and success of digital content.

The main application of Vead is to improve the experience of watching movies, listening to music and playing video games by giving vibration feedback about different events in entertainment content, such as explosions, collisions, fights, shots, crashes and music rhythms, among others. Besides providing feedback, Vead is also able to gather users? vital data about specific moments when watching, listening or playing media content. To this extent, this technology can classify users? reactions when experiencing frightening, heart-rending, suspense, altogether magical events.

In the media content world, Vead can attract people to specific content by enhancing realism into user experiences through stimulating the senses and allowing the user to feel the action and nuance of media content. On the other hand, Vead can also gather and transmit, to a cloud database, user senses data during the entire media content exhibition, allowing third-party services to classify or review its content. Since criticism is simply far too subjective, a multimedia content reviewing depends of the context of the viewing circumstances. Controversial reviewing always arises, where some people classify content as a masterpiece, but others absolutely disgust it. In such a context, Vead Analytics can add a new user-independent and detailed quality measure to be used not only by the critic but, most importantly, to be used by directors and producers for the development of ever more emotional and impactful content.

Similarly to what happens today with reusable 3D glasses, Vead can also be used as an add-on device in specific and controlled environments, such as amusement parks, videogame areas, interactive museums and cinema theaters. In such an application, Vead would not only provide a completely novel experience to its users but also provide critical data about their experiences, which may later be used to further improve the content.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

ÿ

Our high added value is to be able to capture and design exclusive articles to be adapted in every body section, providing the complete supply chain: from unique costumer biometric data designs to production and delivery. The customer buys it online in our web app and we manufacture using existing third-party services or partners in function of type of compliment/product.

ÿ

The project is based in the instant capture of biometric data of a body using a kinect device, mobile/tablet camera, TV cameras, or other devices, to create a 3D model of the user as a 3D exportable file. The model will be divided in parts of the body: head, face, arm, foot, hand?,and in every part, different customizable products can be applied, always according to its biometric data.

ÿ

These biometric data will be used for two main business purposes:

ÿ

Fashion and jewelry accessories (made through virtual pattern in textiles and digital manufacturing).
	Orthopedic devices, completely adapted to customer?s biometric data.
ÿ

The project is a cloud-based platform which could interact with the user in different ways and with several devices, in the future, that for sure will come soon, also with google glasses, smartphones with 3D captures, among others.

ÿ

The project aims to be innovative in order to give a perfect fit solution to every person in function of their own 3D model data, going out from current mass production of fashion and complements or orthopedics conventional solutions and giving a perfect adaptation to users/customers.

ÿ

The platform can be used in two levels, with the different sectors taken into account:

ÿ

Fashion &amp; Jewelry accessories. Open online platform to worldwide users, with less accuracy and with different plan levels: BASIC or PREMIUM. Including different options and designs for each selected plan.
	Orthopedic devices. Due to the fact that the need of specialist advice is important, the end customer could meet directly with the specialist. The online platform will be customized for these specialists, searching the best accuracy scanners of body and providing all support to scan, design, manufacture and delivery according to specialist indications. In this case, the final user of the article will be a customer of our orthopedics specialist customer.

Public offer: Fixing a small price per picture, anyone will be able to sell their photo multiple times to an unlimited number of buyers, who will then share the image rights of the picture. An event, a disaster, or a gossip novelty. For example, in a few seconds we will be able to transfer a last-minute capture of the new war situation in Syria to the front webpage of a major online newspaper.
	Dynamic Auctions: The most exclusive photos, those that the customers will want just for themselves, will be sold in our dynamic auction system. The winner will have the exclusive rights over the image.
	Treasure Hunt: By announcing their future needs worldwide, our corporate users will be able to request a specific image, fixing the price and the time window for it to be obtained. The first hunter whose image is accepted will receive the prize. Finally,ÿgeo-localizing the hunts we will mobilize our users by letting them now when there is an opportunity near them in a new era of social games.
The global written press media is going to be one of the main customers of Just Now?s products. Paradoxically the technological revolution has transformed its traditional business model; greatly reducing its advertising income. This situation has forced all the important newspapers to go on-line, struggling to keep their margins, and overall survive.

In recent years we listen frequently of theÿgeolocationÿof users via Internet or GPS and its great possibilities for recommendations of bars and restaurants, or just orient a map of the mobile over a certain direction.ÿPlatforms likeÿFoursquareÿhave tried to exploit these technologies to serve as guides for tourists in cities they found abundant information from museums or entertainment.ÿHowever, until now,ÿthe uses of geolocation have clashed with few adverse realities notÿlike spending the battery or the high cost ofÿdata roaming abroadÿ, among other problems.The ""beacons"", emitting signals Bluetooth short-range, could be the solutionÿ.ÿThere is even talk of them as substitutes for technologyÿNFCÿ.ÿ

Our BCOMÿits great potential and advantages over the geolocation by GPS.

A ""beacon"" is a small device size -of a coin 50 cents euro emitting a signal on shortwave Bluetooth technology, whose maximum range is 50 meters.ÿSignal, which is composed of three numeric values is unique for each device and can be located by another tracking device.

?Beacon"" is a term used in maritime transport to define the light signals emitted at night and boats can be used for reference.ÿIn digital technology, itsÿfunctionÿis equivalent to: define a location in space based on the signal emitted by the ""beacon"", so that from a smartphone that has a tracking application installed that signal is detected.ÿFrom this premise, you can configure the signal to detect them who is bound to a particular message (text, multimedia or combination of both) will appear on the mobile screen.

We are focusing in apply this technology in Europe because at the moment only Apple store and Macy's in New York has incorporated the ""beacons, the phone will find the deals and additional information on each product, when accessing the golf scope of the corresponding ""beacons"". Of course, these ""beacons"" have been shaped by the facility staff and placed in convenient locations.

But for now, few more examples of shops and SERVICES using ""beacons"" to provide additional information and offers. In Spain, for example, are nonexistent.

We want to use beacons across the city to works for the quality of citizen'e lives.

In the case of CULTURE, MONUMENTS, MUSEUMS, these devices could inform each artwork to the user closer to them.ÿ

In the ADMINISTRATION, could lead us to where we need to do a certain management, or we would INFORM PUBLIC TRANSPORT available within 50 meters from our position. In SHOPS, MARKET or even on the STREET , they could launch offers, advertising, or lead us to certain PLACES of INTEREST. But all this depends on the COMPANIES and INSTITUTIONS are encouraged to buy our BCOM, which is a hardware plus a configure software and you just need to place them in the right places.

The ""beacons"" have severalÿadvantagesÿcompared toÿGPS technologyÿfor geolocation in proximity.ÿThe first is that the activation of Bluetooth connectivityÿconsumes much less battery powerÿthan GPS mode, so if we are, tourism and away from the hotel, we will not go to recharge the battery.

The second is that, being anÿindependent technology data networkÿ-the GPS tracking on mobile is not-we can use abroad to inform us of events and attractions, without fear for the cost of roaming data.

Another advantage is that it is a technology that, unlike GPS, continues to operate inside buildings with high accuracy, which is known as""indoor"" geolocation . Also, thanks to its short range, can more accurately know the cultural and commercial offer around us , without having to view information on places that are too far from our range, as now happens with the geolocation by GPS.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

ÿ

Background 

The project was born in Barcelona, smart-city model, where mobile technologies are causing profound changes in the reading habits. But there is a very limited supply of high-quality interactive multimedia content, and very few examples of books with gamification and links between physical and digital worlds. One reason for these shortcomings is the lack of affordable tools that allow content creators to access these technologies.

ÿ

Idea

We want to make resources available which will allow authors and publishers to provide interactive multimedia stories to a digital generation. These resources will let them incorporate image, video, audio, geolocation augmented reality and social networks to their productions easily, to achieve truly enhanced storytelling.

ÿ

The applicant has worked for the past two years developing this type of content, and has seen the lack of tools available firsthand, which compels us to use custom programming services for each product. Furthermore, she has also come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to develop a new technology, but to combine existing technologies in an innovative way.

ÿ

The launch of the CreatiFI program and FIWARE technologies represents a quantum leap, since it offers the possibility of building such a tool. Using them, a significant cost decrease is possible, thanks to open source resources and financial aid. The technology needed fits perfectly into the philosophy of FIWARE enablers, which will be integrated into a user-friendly online multimedia editing tool that we call PopARbooks?.

ÿ

This trademark, owned by the applicant, shows the bases of the business idea:

?Pop?, related to the traditional pop-up books, where a sheet of paper becomes a 3D object.
	?AR?, related to Augmented Reality technologies and geolocation.
	?books?, because the product provided is a new book concept.
ÿ

Tool

PopARbooks? is designed for authors and publishers without programming skills who want to integrate all kinds of digital formats. The tool allows a wide range of storytelling: from the non-linear (""choose your adventure"" stories where the user makes decisions that affect the plot) to simpler options, such as multimedia ebooks (interactive or not) and conventional books enhanced with extra content for mobile devices.

ÿ

Currently, even the simplest of these options requires custom programming for each product. On the contrary, PopARbooks? delivers mobile apps for iOS, Android and Windows, ready for sale, which use physical locations and objects to interact with. These apps can run offline (when content is stored in them), or online (using the cloud), depending on the amount of information. And no coding is required.

ÿ

Prototype and sample

We will deliver a tool prototype as well as an example made with it. They both will show the editing process of interactive multimedia storytelling, in both digital and paper enhanced editions.

ÿ

The grant will be entirely devoted to developing that tool, and it will also be useful to increase its visibility.

ÿ

The sample delivered will be an interactive ""choose your adventure"" story kind, that will use physical objects and geolocation to offer alternative plots when interacting. It is an adaptation of the novel titled ?Barcelona Roman Steampunk?, part of the transmedia universe called ?MNI?, created, registered and commercialized under the prize-winning brand Barcelona-Robot?, owned by the applicant.

ÿ

This story has been chosen for its ability to illustrate the scalability of the tool, which is useful in both local (Barcelona) and global (any city with cultural heritage) markets.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

Stories are defined as story elements (text, audio, video, images) that are connected to GPS points. A web application allows easy authoring of location stories, which can then be published on the platform. Users can use the mobile app to search for stories in the cities they are visiting, and then follow those stories.

						ÿ

						Location-based Stories

						ÿ

						These location-based stories are stories that the user reads as he/she follows a path through a city or specific location. The path is defined by the story narrative. The platform focuses not only on content (or stories) delivery but also on content creation, so that users can either consume and create content as-they-go, contributing to a community of storytellers. In addition, the storyteller can sell their stories and build revenue out of their work.

						ÿ

						On the mobile app, users will follow the story elements of the stories, which are small chapters of the story containing text, audio and/or images and attached to a location by GPS tags. Users will also be able to create stories/document their trips as they visit the city with the mobile app.

						ÿ

						This allows travelers that have grown up with smartphones and the internet a more engaging way to discover and experience cities while traveling. Millennial travelers (aged 25-35) represent one of the main growth area of tourism and are looking for alternative ways to travel. In this way, LIR provides them an ideal platform for discoing cities in a more engaging and social way than simply reading Wikipedia or joining a tour group.

						ÿ

						With the web-app platform, users can create stories, or enhance the stories created with the mobile app with advanced editing options. Also, they will be able to manage their accounts and stories, including publishing stories to their friends privately or publicly and even sell the stories.

						ÿ

						Business Models

						ÿ

						LIR seeks to focus on three main business models: selling stories, location ads, and sponsored stories.

						ÿ

						The selling of stories would be similar to the business value of ebooks, with a cost of 3-10 Euros per story. From each story sold the author would retain 70% of the story price and LIR would be paid 30%. This price point is comparable to ebooks or tourist guides, and would give authors a clear idea of their revenue potential for planning and writing stories.

						ÿ

						Much as Google has monitized search, we view locations cities as entities which users browse through. By integrating ads into the stories, LIR can bring in revenue and also improve revenue for local businesses. Ads would be related to the story content as well as to the location, making them a natural extension of the story and not an element which users see as something to ignore.

						ÿ

						The sponsored story model is similar to the model of sponsorship in the movie industry. Brands or other institutions (tourist, museums, etc.) could provide custom stories which integrate with events such as concerts, exhibitions, etc. The sponsorship model essentially addresses the B2B possibility of brands paying to produce and feature content and boost the value of locations for their events.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

It is a new Social Networking Site (SNS) and Microblogging platform with a twist: writen messages are automatically tagged with the sender?s current geo-location and these can only be seen by nearby users. The way users see messages is through an Augmented Reality (AR) app for smartphones, tablets and smart glasses: the user?s device uses its own camera to show reality though its screen and, if any message is nearby the user?s current location, it?s overlayed on-screen in its tagged geo-location.

ÿ

This application comes in a moment where use of smart devices is totally accepted among population and wearables like smart glasses are around the corner. People are used to participate in social networks, to tweet his own thoughts, to tell a friend about a sponsored Facebook page and, also, an important base of mobile devices have incorporated tools like Twitter to their day-life. So, why not gave people a micro-blogging tool, easy to use, with the addition of seeing only nearby messages, overlayed on-screen in the view of the camera device.

ÿ

I.e., a user just lunched in a restaurant and, at the local entrance, opens AR Twit in his mobile phone, focus on the restaurant and writes ?Good lunch at a reasonable price! Must try it!?. He publishes his post and since this moment any other AR Twit user nearby will be able to read it. Not so after, another user opens his AR Twit app on his tablet and scans his surroundings and notices an icon over a restaurant at the end of the street. He touches the icon and a message appears on screen: ?Good lunch at a reasonable price! Must try it!?.Why don?t give it a try? After having a nice lunch at the same restaurant, the second user opens AR Twit and gives +1 points to the first user?s post. Who will be next? Maybe that girl with her smart glasses on, turning down the street?

The main features of this business idea are:

A messaging service where users can share their thoughts (or content), listen to experts (or brands) they like, discover new places or follow the latest local trends.
	The service uses an app for mobile devices that show on the camera view any message nearby, represented by an icon (and excerpt of it) in it?s tagged geo-location.
	When the user touches a message, its full text can be read, its writter, its creation ÿ/ expiration date and, also its puntuation.
	Users can sign-up for an account for free.
	Users are able to follow other users.
	Promoted accounts are available (for businesses, brands and celebrities) through Cost-Per-Follow (CPF).
	Developers will be granted an API for integrating our messaging system with other (location based) applications.
	About the messages:
	Can only be published by registered users.
		User name will be shown in the message.
		Can be public (viewable by all users) or private (only for some / none users).
		Can?t exceed 140 characters, as in Twitter.

ÿ

We are applying to CreatiFI because we want to develop a FIWARE-based mobile app linked to our existing print advertising media, called Notebloc. We aim to digitally enhance our physical product.

ÿ

Notebloc is an A4-sized paper notebook, free for university students. It works as an advertising tool for brands which want to reach this target by placing their campaigns inside the most useful item that a student has: his notebook.

ÿ

The new Notebloc app will allow students to digitalize their class notes taken on their Notebloc notebook, align them (hence, to put the notes straight even though the student captures them from another angle), remove the grid-lined background, access notes from any device (computer, tablet and smartphone), store, print and share them online. At the same time, brands will have a new media to personalise campaigns based on data inferred from the app usage (Big Data), use augmented reality and location-based features.

ÿ

WHAT WE WANT TO DEVELOP

ÿ

In order to understand better the concept behind our CreatiFI applicantion, it is important to understand the context where Notebloc operates:

ÿ

Notebloc is a free, A4-sized, spiral paper notebook for university students in Spain. These notebooks are customized for each university we work with and distributed to its students twice per academic year. The notebooks contain pages of advertising from brands that want to reach and engage with the student target.

ÿ

The first university to adopt the Notebloc notebook was Universitat Ramon Llull, with 18,000 students. URL is one of the most prestigious, private universities in Spain(e.g. ESADE business school is part of this university). The first brand to believe in our idea and buy advertising space in Notebloc was Levi's, a world-renowned fashion brand. The first Notebloc edition turned out to be a success amongst students (who loved receiving free notebooks), the university (who got a new powerful, free branding tool) and the brands (who reached their target in a memorable, efficient and direct way while fulfilling their advertising goals).ÿ

ÿ

In less than 12 months since the first free notebook was released, we now reach more than 142,000 university students in Catalonia (Spain), who represent more than 70% of them in this Autonomous Community. On the clients side, we count with international brands such as Levi?s, Reebok, SuperDry, BBVA and Acer Computers. Regarding universities, Notebloc is working with Universitat de Barcelona (best ranked Spanish university worldwide), among others.

ÿ

This story of success happens in the midst of the Global Crisis, which has affected the Advertising and Print Media especially hard.

ÿ

In conversations with brands and students, we identified other needs that we could eventually cover:

ÿ

Brands:ÿThere are some brands that have shifted to a 100% online &amp; mobile advertising strategy, meaning that they cannot participate in our notebook but would participate in a digital media for students. Some existing clients have shown interest in doing a 360-degree communication strategy through Notebloc, meaning that they would place more of their advertising investment in Notebloc if we had a digital channel for them to reach students.

ÿ

Students:ÿOur surveys show that more than 95% of the students who got a Notebloc use it in class. On the other hand, though, an increasing percentage of students uses electronic devices for studying purposes (taking and sharing notes). At the same time, students show interest in receiving more targeted advertising and discounts from brands.

ÿ

Because of this yet unmet needs, we develop the Notebloc app, which will serve both brands and students on their short and long term goals.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

Project 1. Cinema listings map.

ÿ

Mobile and web application with cinema listings presented on an interactive map. A list of cinemas and films programmed in the area on a determined day are shown on the map. Are shown only the list of theaters and movies that are in the visible area of the map. The user can see on the map the schedule of a film in all theaters in an area at the same time.


The application is done as web prototype for Spain, there is a functional prototype / mockup in http://www.mapacines.es/inde_x.php (search barcelona, Spaineg). We believe that it is much more meaningful for mobile devices, as it uses maps and provides information related to the user's location at the time of use, which makes itÿ useful in order to gather the information inÿ and contextualised way based on the position and location of the user.

Project 2. Cinema listings developers web.


Website for developers and webmasters, with a number of services based on Cinema listings data.


The website will contain:

1) An API with which can obtain the data of the cinema listings (theater showtimes and films).
2) Files in xml or json updated daily with the theater showtimes.
3) Widgets based in this data for blogs or websites.
4) A website for promotion, where are listed the applications developed with these data.

317,CREA317,CREA,CREAtiFi,Spain,Startup,NEWSKID,"Buenos Aires, 6, 08320 El Masnou (Barcelona), Spain",TELECOM AND MEDIA,B2B,4,0,YES,IN,Eva Dominguez,"The newspaper industry is struggling with a steadily decline in sales. Engaging young readers is one of the keys to assess this sector?s future. At a time when the press is facing its most volatile decline, catering for the journalistic needs of children seems one of the most sensible investments. While news services for the young audience are not a new idea, there is still a gap in the market for an innovative approach both in terms of the business model and in the concept and development of the idea.


NEWSKID is an independent and interactive visual media experience aimed at young audiences with the goal of making current affairs a fun and engaging experience, while empowering the use of media and information among the younger population. NEWSKID is designed for children from the ground up. It?s transmedia, immersive and participatory. ÿ


The transmedia strategy is based on the use of a print supplement, a web and physical object, and the integration of Augmented Reality technology. Rather than expanding one product across three platforms, each complementary platform has a specific purpose. This transmedia strategy aims to reach a native digital audience through different moments and situations (in school and/or home, online and offline).


This approach has a strong storytelling purpose. Current affairs are explored by a digital character in a way that transcends the borders of each platform. This main character undertakes a storytelling trip through a physical object, a print product and a digital screen.


The project is developed around monthly in-depth news coverage that generates a variety of digital participatory activities. The prototype will focus exclusively on the reporting and technological development of this main topic.
ÿ

NEWSKID?s customers are newspapers, while the target audience consists of children from 8 to 12 years old.


NEWSKID?s customer segment is regional newspapers around the world. While big media assets can include this type of service within their overall strategy, a project of this scope and technical innovation is all too often out of reach for regional newspapers. NEWSKID provides regional papers with the opportunity to reach young audience with an innovative approach at a very low or negligible risk.


Children aged from 8 to 12 years old make up our audience. Children of this age are interested about the world and are very participative. This digital generation is used to playing and learning with digital screens as well as with physical objects. NEWSKID utilizes both techniques in a game-like storytelling based on current events.


NEWSKID?s competitive advantage is based on the conjunction of three main characteristics:


- Licensing business model. The licensing model gives exclusivity to each media in their region at a very competitive price. Since the service is open to regional sponsorship, media companies could benefit from the project for free or even to be profitable if the sponsorship amount is higher than the license agreement cost.


- News core business focus. NEWSKID has a direct impact on the core business of the newspaper, by engaging children with the main role of a news media: reporting on current affairs. Children will associate news reporting with a brand that they might remain loyal to in the future, regardless of platform.


- Use of transmedia strategy and the Internet of Things. The transmedia approach and the use of Augmented Reality to report on current affairs is a highly innovative solution for the media industry. At this moment there is only one service aimed at children using this technology but it?s not related to news and it?s used in a outlying form.

ÿ

""The Internet of Things"" trend is growing exponentially, together with the Smart City concept, more and more our environments are full of sensors and additional context information. However when we think about communication with users (people), we always think on different protocols and ways on communication, but what happen when we talk about big audiences? Can it be consider a group of sensors?

ÿ

Calliope Live Interaction Suite will take advantage of the maturity of the Internet of Things concept to enhance the way of communicating with people according to their context.ÿSensors travel nowadays in our pocket, and more and more the space is gathering information about their context, by this combination a close proximity and spatial contextualized communication can be done, by enabling automatic and/or manual messages (audio, video, text...) at any time to the smartphones, to segregate the users groups according to their context (position, information from sensors near them, group, name, age...).

Calliope system provides a concise and creative tool for deploying complex real time transmedia storytelling according to precise spatial contexts. Caliope will become the reference tool for connecting in a smart way with the new audience of the XXI century.

ÿ

The prototyping and concept idea come from and will be validated in the Performing Arts, by validating the platform with big audiences in a professional environment at the same time that the design and user requirements will be updated according to each iteration and feedback from users (both the ones that send content and those that receive it). However the system, once validated, will have a bigger market as it can be applied to any other event with big audiences (stadiums, concerts, city festivals?) and to other markets, as it can be use not only for leisure but also for second screen/connected TV interaction, advertising campaigns in a commercial center, city information services?

ÿ

To do that it is required the development of the set of tools/modules to enable this real time massive interaction with users and devices. To do that the core development will be based on the FIWARE Generic Enabler ?Orion Context Broker?, that offers us the possibility to easily and efficiently subscribe and public resources and events. The system is compatible with both smartphones and sensors, as we created a simple proof of concept in Fi-WARE Lab.

Also this publication/subscription mechanism easily enables the propagation through the network of interaction commands to create context, and a RESTful system that simplify the client software development. At the same time the ?IDAS? generic enabler will allow us to carried out the system in big scale environments (&gt;1000 devices).",Tech provider,,0,0,X,0,X,,Software,Conferencing Applications,Applications,Collaborative Applications,1,0,0,Group of Entrepreneurs,50000,kalliopesuite.com

It is a nonprofit event that tries to boost the economy, the culture and the knowledge of the environment through cinema. MAREMOSTRA is a thematic film festival, that shows from committed and cultural independent films to blockbusters and commercial cinema. As well, it goes through film sections related to science, activism, fantastic and horror cinema. Maremostra features the BEST INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTIONS, that are linked in some way to the sea.

MAREMOSTRA got to its third edition in 2014 with a succesful result. The festival wants to improve each edition, bringing new services and tools for a better audience support.

MareMostra App will permit to our spectators to experience the festival with updated information and innovative services. The main objectives of this digital tool are:

Real time information about what is going on in the Festival and around it
	All the information (trailer, cast, sinopsis?) about the films and events with the possibility of making a wishlist/favorites.
	All the information about the Schedule of films and events with the possibility of making your own Schedule.
	Tickets and season tickets sale (integrated with social media).
	Film rating (that audiences can share) and surveys that can be shared in social media
	Recomendations by geolocalization and interests (about fims and festival events and other suggestion based on sponsor services).
	Social networks and integrated communication.
	Conversation with festival guests (directors, scientists, actors/actreses, surfers (and other athletes related to the sea). For example, Q&amp;As).
Contests and games: the festival has a short films contest partnered with Microsoft Innovation Center in Tourism Technologies and other contests can be generated to engage audiences through games.ÿ
	Google Hangout for a m ximum of 10 participants related to the festival.
	Torism guide about the festival, filmmakers related to Mallorca and cinema localizations (based on the sellection of films made by the user or after a small survey of five questions). It is known that cultural events atract toursim, this area will try to enagage this cultural tourists.
Besides the services for the festival audience, the app will be a sponsorship opportunity through advertising (banners, animated banners?) and branded content for sections of the app or contests (for companies, institutions and the guest country of the festival) based on the same story telling so we can create better matches between the sponsors and the festival, it will give value to the collaborators, and the tecnology will be available to be bought by other film festivals and cultural events around Europe.

As well, the app will be a tool for real-time reporting that includes audience engagement, calendar adds, ratings &amp; reviews as well as ticket sales. When the festival is over, the app will be able to deliver an executive report with key performance indicators and demographic analysis to help you plan next editions and to inform to your sponsors about the value of their collaboration.

The differenciation of this app to others is that the info will be in real time (information and conversation), will use gamification to engage audiences and will provide recommendations and contextualization by profile and geolocalization.

Executive Summary

We seek to create an app tool to get instant prices of outdoor ad spaces, bringing more transparency into the environment of potential media buyers and business developers looking to give exposure to their products / services. This first physical ""traditional"" ad strategy is often contemplated by most initial stage entrepreneurs as a first affordable step to taste the market, the download and use of such app will get them familiarized with the use of a FI-WARE based app (and will increase the chances of them considering the use of its code to create their own app instead of Android's or Mac's).ÿWe believe this key profile's involvement with FI-WARE apps is an important step to ensure its widespread use in the future.ÿ

Outdoor Ad spaces surrounds and impact us in everyday life. This app would furthermore have the potential to create a less passive approach in every day ad receivers, bringing out the Marketing student in all of us.ÿ

ÿ

Detailed description

The real Marketing soon-to-be graduates will also of course be encouraged to toy with it in their everyday life, students who will in the future lead app projects and marketing campaigns. The existence of a whole education industry surrounding the science of Marketing and Advertising is a perfect lunch pad for such an app, filled with professionals actively looking for news tools to empower students in their path to become experts on such major. Such stakeholders will presumably be easy recruits in the mission of spreading the word about the app's existence and it's use since one of their main role is to get the industry up to speed with the new tools available in our technology based world.ÿ

The app will work through the user's GPS system to determine their location and matching it with the industry's ad display location database in order to inform the user of the different ad platforms surrounding him and their price tag.ÿThe app's development will entail a close collaboration with the industry's main players, who will benefit from the increased transparency of their offered products / services.ÿ

A different mechanism will be set up for locations where GPS is unavailable such as subway stations, indoor multi level buildings, etc.. linking the user to the station / building mapping of the different ad displays for him/her to be able to consult the price tag on such displayed ad spaces. We are also considering the insertion of NFC and QR contactless information sharing technology.ÿ

This detailed display of the industry's ad spaces (which is already mapped by the industry players) will serve to demonstrate the power of FIWARE and the never-ending applications that could be supported through its use, using this apparent complexity as a sort of ""brand"". ÿ

The business model we envision for this app consists of 3 fronts. First of all we think the target audience is a much praised price for some big firms. We would like to propose a sponsorship of the add to big packaging / mailing companies seeking to lure entrepreneur's businesses such as DHL, UPS or FedEx. We believe this to be a key audience for such companies since first step businesses usually entail a lot of samples mailing. Other possible suitors could be Google Adwords or Facebook but these kind of sponsors could be frown upon by the ad display companies we need to work with as they are competitors on a broad level. The second front would be charge per download of 2,99 euros or so. The third front would be to get some commission for sales from the main ad display companies to be discussed with them. This app's audience is not likely to become mass market but its target user is of key interest to numerous industries.ÿ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

Refaber is a web based collaborative network platform that enables responsible innovation with sustainable and local focus. A social network that brings together people with ideas and people who have the capacity to produce them.

Its aim is to establish sustainable local partnerships between design, technology and SMEs in order to generate products, processes and systems around the settlements where people live.

ÿ

ANTICIPATING NEW REALITIES

Internet should not be a tool used to perpetuate the life within the cities as we know them today; instead, it should facilitate their reengineering. As seen within the contemporary debate, the economy of urban innovation is based on cities that will be productive again, with the industry and technology required to relocate the production of goods to where they are consumed. Within this model, new forms of business associated to traditional production will appear; as well as new businesses focusing on value-added and the use of the resources we have.

That is what Refaber reinforces; encouraging the new local productive structures of the XXI century.

ÿ

GOALS

Rebafer engages people to create new local communities and aims to build productive structures on the basis of a circular economy, with emphasis on using ecosystem-based logics and social revenue.

If we act as natural systems do, the creation of new jobs would be entirely possible, while productivity would increase and resources would optimized. The leading cities in the near future will be those that generate more value for their territory with the lowest resource consumption.

ÿ

IMPACT POTENTIAL

Refaber has a disruptive approach within the European scene, with joining the need to activate the creative local economies through the regeneration of our cities, creating clusters of creativity by using a social platform for innovation in the field of real smart cities.

We care about design, the challenges that the local communities are currently facing; and local production towards innovation and ecosystem-based logics.

It is clear that taking advantage during this moment of crisis is not only effective, but also essential for the government and industry leadership. Moreover, a new economic model will only succeed if it promotes the popular business initiatives.

ÿ

EASY AND EFECTIVE NETWORK

In one hand, Refaber platform is an open and free tool to be used to solve challenges where designers, FabLabs, SMEs, research centres and entrepreneurs are involved.

On the other hand, Refaber would have a team of experts that will manage and guide the platform to make it easy for users to find the best option for every challenge proposed.

ÿ

Key points of the success of the platform:

1. An open community of experts solving challenges through ÿinnovative ideas.

2. A network that works by feedbak of platform users (all actors give feedback on services, quality of solutions, prototyping working speed, etc). The community is thus evaluated at all times.

ÿ

A free virtual platform with a working area will be accessed by all participants of each case, which will further lead to a continuous flow of exchange within the users of the community.

Financial revenues of the platform will come from a commission on the fee of every challenge established as well as the recruitment of 'premium' services and workshops to solve challenges, the rental of Refaber facilities, and the Refaber certificate for ecosystem-based logic production.

ÿ

WHY CREATIFI

We ask Creatifi to develop and design the Refaber web-based platform. On parallel we will dimension and test Refaber in order to develop a pilot case, with real people and real economy.

Over the CreatiFI eight months work, we will be transferring the real experiences of the successful pilot case to the application, focusing on quality of the users relationship.

Complemented with two online communities. A community consultants that brings together researchers and professionals who can be hired by the users, and a second community of users that can use the services of consultants, or others hired themselves.The version to public administrations and non-profit organizations allows them to open their community and access to project to the public.

User Community: Skills and location of companies, universities and government.
	Community Consultants: Skills, location and availability of researchers and professionals.
ÿ

The operating principle is crossed by the data input of the user, the open data obtained from public catalogs and shared data generated by the user and consultancy communities. This type of software is included in the group called CAQDAS (Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software).

User Data
	Open Data.
	Shared data community.
ÿ

The software structure is based on the use of qualitative research techniques based on three types of data. The system uses a matrix that encodes the information of the user to filter the data and cross on a building semantic concepts related behaviors, habits, beliefs, motivations, values and conduct obtained from the data that the user can bring through surveys and the shared data provided by the communities. Open data included in the analysis of the matrix, are interpreted as social relations. The functionality of the array based on the epistemological assumptions of social constructivism, where knowledge is not to people as individual beings, but in the social relations between them, so the data are treated as open data social interactions multiple beyond people because test data also legal entity. Therefore, the system applies a qualitative analysis based on social relations that provides current information on social context for activity, trends and geographical.

ÿ

The most complex part of the project is to develop the algorithm of the matrix, it is based on the principle of taxonomic relationships on a context formulated a hypothesis created from the objective of the project, the activities of the elements involved, the social and economic and geographic location. The matrix encodes the data and relationships, creating a design of qualitative research project to work and needs in a report. The contribution to the system of three types of data grows in size increasing users and consultants.

ÿ

The report contains an analysis of the social and economic indicators on which to act. What are the resources available to the user, the chances of success of the project and estimate the rate of return on investment. The report also indicates the need for hiring consultants and the type of tasks to be performed, in order to perform a qualitative analysis customized by user type and scope. If human resources are not sufficient to carry out the project, the report is complemented by a range of professionals according to their skills, location and availability.

ÿ

The application reaches its maximum functionality with a tool online for recruitment consultants that userÿ to need to carry out the project and bring it in practice, by monitoring the process.

The user will be able to create a route with the mobile app, and then use the wearable device to get to their destination without having to look at the mobile phone. It's a new and refreshing way of going around cities of the world.

The main users of this app will be tourists, people that want a new way of going around a city that they might not know that well, and possibly people that want new experiences in their own city. Using the wearable device it will be much easier to go around the city by bike or motorcycle.ÿ

ÿ

It is a new and easier way of going around cities.

ÿ

Here is a list of features that we want to implement in this project:

ÿ

Project Features

ÿ

1 - The user will be able to create routes using the mobile app. 

2 - The routes will be displayed using the wearable device.

3 - The wearable device will guide the user to their destination using a user interface that can be customized in the mobile app.

4 - There will be an option, in which the route is displayed in the mobile app, using augmented reality.

5 - The augmented reality feature can be customized. The user can select the information that wants to be displayed. For example, the user might want to know the pharmacies that are around him/her as he/she walks through the route.

6 - There are different feature packs that can be purchased using the profile of the user in the web page. The augmented reality feature is an example of that.

7 - There will also be custom designs of the UI of the wearable that will be available in the web page to be purchased.

8 - When the user buys the app and device, a profile will be created in the web page in order for the user to manage his/her account.

9 - In the section of custom designs, the user will be able to review and give feedback of them.

10 - There will be an option for the user to create a route based on the recommendations of the application. These recommendations will be based on the preferences and past routes of the user or the friends of the user.

11 - The user will have the option to connect the social media profiles with this application to share the routes in social media and to be suggested similar routes or routes that were created by their facebook friends.

12 - Another premium feature will be for the device to inform the user that one of his/her friends is in the area, performing another route.

13 - The wearable device, when purchased, can be customized via the web page.

14 - In the web page, there will be several different routes that can be purchased. Typical routes would be for example tours between the main monuments of a city.

ÿ

Museums are going through a major transformation. With the reduction of public funding, they are challenged to behave like companies. To remain sustainable, they now need to monitor performance and boost attendance. Like other businesses, they need more reliable KPIs and extensive audience data (demographics, recurrence, motivation, satisfaction).

ÿ

Market

ÿ

There are 18.886 museums in Europe. 43% of museums offer a mobile experience and 23% plan to offer it in the next year. The average expenditure in digital tools is 30.000 ?/year.

ÿ

The most popular goal of mobile projects is visitors? engagement, followed by providing additional content (2) and interactive experience (3). The least popular goal is revenue.

ÿ

Problem

ÿ

Challenges museums face to deliver a mobile experience:

Acquire mobile users
	Create content and keep it updated
	Technical maintenance
	Evaluate ROI
ÿ

Museums are frustrated with the low ROI of mobile projects. They are open to try innovative solutions.

ÿ

Solution

ÿ

One of the most effective strategies to increase visits is to generate engagement. The WSJ recently published an article about crowdsourcing in museums: Sta Cruz Museum achieved twice more visitors, 4 times more donations and a whooping 20 times more grants by adopting a more participative approach in the last 3 years.

ÿ

Unique Visitors (UV) is a digital platform to manage and promote visitors? participation, creating engagement. Our concept is to crowdsource museum tours. We will make it extremely easy and intuitive for anyone to create and share their recommendations inside a museum.

ÿ

Visitors will become prosumers, creating a recommendation database that will help future visitors to have better and personalized experiences. Prosumers become ambassadors, inviting friends to visit the museum. In this virtuous cycle we generate engagement and create UGC.

ÿ

Value proposition

ÿ

Boost visits

	Improve visitors? experience
		Increase recurrence
		Participation/engagement
		Synergies with other museum, sharing audiences
		Improve CRM and personalized communication
		Empower visitors to recruit new audiences
	
	Create UGC and increase online impact
	Structure recommendations in a repository that will be useful for other visitors
		Facilitate sharing of compelling content on social networks
		New ways of seeing the same collection
	
	Get metrics
	Track user interaction on dashboard
		Segmented data: Demographics (age, gender, origin), habits (schedules, preferences, recurrence), motivation (search), interest (heat map) and satisfaction (ratings, comments)
	
	Reduce costs of mobile user acquisition
ÿ

Business Model

ÿ

Instead of creating isolated digital projects, museums can subscribe to UV. Pricing will vary from 2.000? to 10.000? annually (rev. model and pricing were contrasted with managers of top Barcelona museums).

ÿ

It is a scalable B2B business model. When we acquire a solid user base, UV can pivot or expand to other models (B2C).

ÿ

Competitive advantage

ÿ

We developed a throwaway prototype (proof of concept) where we tested demand and interest of museums and visitors. We also tested usability and UX. We have 225 users and 418 newsletter subscribers (50% of which are museum professionals).

ÿ

UV is endorsed by Museu Nacional d?Art de Catalunya and Fundaci¢ T?pies (see letters of recommendation). Both agreed to be the first pilots.

ÿ

Anticipated demand

ÿ

We are developing a limited UV version for Barcelona City Hall (Barcelona Activa) and were requested quotes for 2 other custom versions.

ÿ

Early recognitions

Eating is always permeated with meaning and what we eat is a powerful symbol of what we are: our ethnicity, social, cultural, and religious also passes through the food code, one of the most powerful, if not the largest, between the cultural codes. In every culture foods preparation, way of serving and consumption habits play a central role. This central role can be used for a better multicultural integration: this is the simple cornerstone and mission of the BREAD initiative.

Usually, this mandates the development of additional skills (e.g. relevant to presentation or entreprenship).
 Within PitchPoint, the StudentLife team will develop a new service called ?PitchPoint?, which includes
 -an arena for students to pitch their skills to find job positions. This arena can be considered as a marketplace where students pitch their skills and potential employers can select the most appropriate candidate and ?meet? him/her through the platform video-conferencing tools.
 -a marketplace for training material and tutoring services. Training suppliers (either students or professionals) declare their offerings - targeted skill/course, type of material and activity, pricing scheme (free or not and charge rate). Interested students and graduates select the training resource that matches their interest and once they try it, they rate it to enable quality ranking. The training services can be offered on charge, free of charge or can be traded based on platform-specific points encouraging exchange of knowledge among students.
 The PitchPoint platform will support material upload both for students pitching and for training material and social networking functionality to facilitate communication among the involved stakeholders.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,#N/A,#N/A,3,0,0,SME,149500,studentlife.com.cy

Bee API introduces a new urban business model for an ancestral and rural activity allowing a larger deployment of apiculture in urban areas: Any citizen, company, or city having appropriate locations to do so, can rent and host beehives to locally produce honey. The hives are managed by experienced beekeepers, operating as services providers who can anticipate and plan their operations thanks to to the remote control of the Bee API hives : embedded sensors and actuators provide the capability to manage the status of a hive from web services and apps. The harvested honey is shared by the host and the beekeeper.

ease bees and cities inhabitants cohabitationÿ
	optimize urban beekeepers logistics
	implement agile and ultra-short distribution channels

61% of the budget for producing the top console games is spent on creating art. In 2014, greater than $3bn will be spent on the generation of art assets for video games. This industry has identified the rising art costs as their largest problem.

The Artomatix solution is an automated art-creation software application that will significantly disrupt the content production process for video games. The goal is to halve the time and halve the cost to make a video game.

The overall objective of Artomatix is to deliver the next generation of graphics tools, based upon our proprietary A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) system that can mimic human-like artistic creativity and can semi-automate the process based on input examples.

By semi-automating the generation of art, Artomatix will expand the games market and significantly disrupt the current art creation process by:

Enabling digital graphic artists to focus on high-creativity tasks rather than spending time on mundane low-creativity tasks (e.g. painting each individual brick in a wall)
	Improving art generation efficiency and consequently reducing project times and costs
	Providing studios with the means to keep art creation in-house, thus reducing or eliminating their reliance on Asian Art outsourcers
In the longer term, this technology will enable people (e.g. game designers) who lack artistic training/talent to manifest their vision.

ÿ

The Artomatix Cloud Project is focused on porting the present 'stand-alone' prototype Artomatix technology to the Cloud, using FIWARE technology on the backend and also for the required 3D user interface.ÿ

The traceability of resources, patients and professionals will improve the efficiency of health services avoiding errors due to patient misidentification, optimizing the use of resources, reducing administrative tasks and automating processes. Reduced processing times will be achieved by improving the management of the professional activity and allowing a reduction in costs.

ÿ

Since there is no location method that can be applied to all needs and environments, the simultaneous integration of different systems will add value to the project. This will be a differential aspect compared to existing solutions in the market, highly focused on location management and limited, generally, to a specific location technology. Furthermore, storing all events in persistent systems or distributed storage (BigData) will not only enable compliance with current legislation, but it will also enable the data analysis across distributed methods.

In summary, this project is aimed to develop, demonstrate, prepare, take up and use of the present proposal.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

Creativity and innovation are widely recognized as of crucial importance for the functioning of modern organizations, commercial and non-commercial alike. This is equally true for the ability of employees to solve problems and engage in informal learning. Each of these processes relies on the flow of knowledge between employees, which in turn is contingent on the social cohesion and the transparency of the knowledge distribution in the organization. Knowledge silos exist, often between departments, preventing many larger organizations to achieve a higher level of creativity and innovation through collaborative problem solving and informal learning.

The Sparker way

Sparker runs on a number of tables, placed at strategic social locations in the organization. The tablets are connected to an RFID reader. Employees can perform check-ins on the tablet using their Sparker RFID card to score points for their team. They can engage in a Sparker conversation, by checking in with another player of their team. Both players are presented with a number of conversation topics that are based on their user profiles. By performing these actions, players can score point for their teams. The overall state of the game and the recent activity can be followed through a responsively designed website. In addition, the website allows participants to perform missions that are tuned to organizational goals, like contributing ideas through a crowdsourced ideation campaign. As players need to fill out their profiles in order to participate, this data becomes available to the organizational leadership, who can query it and perform analysis using the Analytics dashboard. This yields insights in the interests and competencies of the employees, which can be used to e.g. find out what issues are alive in the organization or to create teams in a more targeted way, combining different areas of expertise. At its core, Sparker provides a new way of letting people meet in a meaningful way. It offers an experience that brings people together and stimulates them to build social contacts that are based on meaningful discussions. The ZWERM prototype, on which Sparker is based, produced design research knowledge on how to build systems that activate and consolidate the social fabric. Our paper ?ZWERM: a Modular Component Network Approach for an Urban Participation Game? won a ?SIGCHI Best of CHI Honorable Mention Award? at the CHI 2014 conference and we believe that it would be a missed opportunity not to bring this type of application to the market.

Primary market

The market and especially the ?Learning &amp; Development? segment has sent out a number of positive signals, strengthening our belief that the concept has market potential. Nowadays, the vision on learning has changed from strictly formal to a combination of formal, informal and social learning. However, there is lack of clear insights and data on where knowledge is located in the organization and how knowledge can be exchanged between colleagues. Sparker solves these issues to a certain extent, making it a promising instrument for engaging in social learning and obtaining data on future needs and opportunities.
We have engaged in a track at BNP-Paribas Fortis to implement Sparker for their 17.000 strong staff. In addition, we have received interest from Belfius bank to test the application when it is finished.

Secondary markets

Focusing on large organization with knowledge silo?s looking for ways to engage their employees in a playful way is the most promising marketing strategy at this time. However, we have also identified that the concept would be applicable to spark social cohesion at events (conferences, business fairs,...) in schools (to server educational content) or in cities (as was done in ZWERM).",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

The easierLife system compares this data with the residents habits, thus information about a resident?s well-being can be extracted. With easierLife relatives can be informed via text-message, mobile app or web-interface about the situation in the senior?s home, to know whether everything is alright.

ÿ

The technical basis for our system consists of real-time sensor data from the households of elderly people transferred to our cloud infrastructure for rule-based situation recognition. To provide additional long-term data analysis for the new preventive system machine learning modules and the FIWARE big data module - ?Cosmos? need to be integrated. Cosmos will analyze long-term sensor data from ambient Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices at home in combination with the latest tools in machine learning, e.g. SciKit-learn, and Big Data processing to cluster the data.

ÿ

With this project it becomes possible to provide early feedback about degradation in people?s activity level and health. As a result awareness, about possible health changes (e.g. beginning dementia) of seniors can be recognized at an early stage. This allows seniors and their relatives to take preventive action. In general health degradation can be stopped or slowed down significantly, which means a rise in people?s quality of life and even more it is an extraordinary efficient approach to counteract the problem of rising health care costs.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

ÿ

People are using smart phones all the time, app stores contain millions of apps. There are many apps that could be really helpful to people at their current location or in their current situation, if they just could find them.

ÿ

When searching for apps suited for their needs, users don't get much help from app stores.

By doing a textual search, users get results listed in an unstructured way ranked by mostly undocumented factors like downloads, price and user ratings.
Example: enter ""airport"" in the iPhone App Store when near Cologne and you get Utilities, Games, Taxi Apps, Translators, an app for the Munich Airport, more games and so on.

ÿ

SORA allows users to optionally fill their profile so that SORA knows about hometown, native language, age, gender, family status.

ÿ

SORA will assist users with a portal that provides smart app findings based on:

ÿ

- recommendation based on location and time
If you arrive at a location for the first time, a city guide and a translation app may be of interest, later you may want an app showing you restaurants nearby or events at this evening.

ÿ

- recommendation on profile
Based on your profile SORA gets smarter over time by offering choices of users with similar profiles.

ÿ

- smart textual search results by applying advanced text analysis

By applying advanced text analysis on all app descriptions in a store we will be able to detect the context to which apps belong and group the search results into categories.

Now the user can decide which category (public airports for example) is of interest, without the need watch thousands of apps that are not in focus.
Using this technology SORA can also present apps that don't match the search text but belong to the same group (category) as otherÿmatching apps.

ÿ

Artifacts Editor

The tool to be developed is an in-game editor for defining in-game artifacts and its subsequent use in-game.
One of the most important tasks to perform in a video game is to define the artifacts that are used and the definition of the different values they will take.
In the world of videogames, weapons (swords, guns, etc), NPC's, vehicles (cars, motorcycles, spaceships, etc) are concepts (archetypes) that must be used for definition and creation, while having a software at design level that:
1. It makes possible to share information with all the roles involved
2. It is available at any time
3. It makes maintenance easier
4. It is integrated into the content creation tool in a clear way.
ÿ

Just as an example, in MMO games this allows:
1. Maintain persistent objects in time and ""space"" (instances of play)
2. Keep track of the evolution of an in-game item (such as historical price of an item)

Track System

Collects events that have been defined by the designers / marketing / developers to offer:
1. Tracking that can be used as a debugging tool.
2. Source of data to be exploited by other departments (marketing, monetization, etc)

It is possible to simulate/preview the app before testing and finally deploying it on the actual devices.

Even though no programming experience is required, the tool can be profitably used by professional developers and software houses as well, to accelerate development for applications that are suited for our framework or for rapid prototyping.

ÿ

The objective of this proposal is to expand Foneclay scope to support Internet of Things (IoT) application.

We believe that the initial deployment of the IoT will be quite fragmented in terms of standards, systems and types of objects. In this environment, our goal is to accelerate IoT adoption by providing a development framework that simplifies app design/development and deployment.

Gobblin? Goblinz is a mobile casual shoot em up for Android, iOS and Windows Phone devices.

Premise

The opposing parties of the game are goblins, or ?goblinzes? using the traditional goblin language. The two tribes are named Blz (more ball like goblins) and Blx (more angular goblins). Their most characteristic and shared trait is the voracious appetite for delicacies. Unlike Blz, Blx are readily willing to steal these goodies, especially from Blz

ÿ

Target audience

Target players are casual mobile game players in age group 7-20 (the same as with Angry Birds).

The game is targeted for all mobile devices with Android, iOS or Windows Phone, even ones with a bit older hardware.

Gameplay

The device is in portrait position. The paddle monsters sit on the bottom corners. The Blz roll on the paddle monsters? arms. Blx start falling from the top of the scene, trying to reach the bottom of the scene. The player starts tapping the paddle monsters to swing Blz at them. When a Blz hits a Blx, both are destroyed.

ÿ

In addition to generic SHMUPs, one can easily find similarities to games like Tetris (Blx falling from top screen) and pinball (paddle monsters? arms).

ÿ

Wave after wave the Blx attack in wildly varying forms and formations. Each wave is a fast paced puzzle for the player to solve. When destroyed, many special Blx provide special Blz to the player. 

ÿ

When the player has destroyed all the Blx in one level, she can move to the next level. A single battle comprises about 10 levels. When all levels of a battle are overcome, the player can move to the next battle with a new theme and challenges. In total, the game contains a campaign with 10 battles.

The Experience Connector is a data platform that connects to our customers? existing online touchpoints where data is generated. Via the Connector, our platform captures the data in a central database, and consolidates analysis results in a unified dashboard. This allows our customers to gather insights in near realtime, enabling them to anticipate rapidly on e.g. customer behaviour or trends across their touchpoints.

ÿ

Based on the insights from the platform, we can feed more customized experiences to the touchpoints, closing the loop. For this purpose, we plan to offer marketing managed services in conjunction with the platform.

The Experience Connector is a data tool that connects multiple technologies and protocols coming from online customer touchpoints where data is generated. Via the ?connector? the tool merges all gathered data into a unified dashboard pulling out and pushing in data in the central database. This allows organisations to quickly gather insights in a dynamic way enabling fast anticipation on e.g. customer behaviour or trends across many touchpoints running on all kinds of technology. Having a single view on a customer and getting valuable insights from in a unified view is possibile. The data streams with highly personalised contextual information can be used to generate customized experiences by assembling realtime frontends based on the data. All activities are new data input feeding the database and are again the start of new activities. A corresponding catalogue of marketing services that can be executed by external parties or inhouse staff is developed. 

ÿ

Our offering is assembled-to-measure by connecting a variety of data sources. The aim is to be as technology independent as possible, so organisations can avoid vendor lock-in and could replace or add components through time without losing their data and experiences in touchpoints. The solution offers full control over the data and the locations it is stored complying with most security and legal standards.

sophisticated sensors that are embedded in the phone or are wirelessly connected to it, data can be continuously captured and
general health-related metrics can be derived. This empowers people to take a more active role in the management of their
personal well-being, and contributes to a model of prevention, early diagnosis and continuous care.
Gociety today offers the GoLiveEngine, consisting of the GoLivePhone and the GoLiveAssist web portal, that
captures objective data from sensors in the smartphone,
performs basic activity recognition and estimates number of steps and calorie consumption,
intelligently uses data for fall risk assessment & detection, and basic wandering and inactivity detection, and
visualises data through dashboards, mostly in a passive and static way.
In this project, Gociety will integrate selected FIWARE enablers into the GoLiveEngine in order to provide the user and his
caregiver with more added-value insights and advanced functionalities for remote monitoring, prevention and early diagnosis.
This will be achieved by:
capturing additional objective data through the integration of extra sensors into the platform, i.e.
the GoLiveWear, a weighing scale and blood pressure meter
complementing the objective data with subjective data captured through questionnaires, i.e.
optimally-timed feedback on overall wellbeing status, recognized activities and lifestyle patterns
further exploiting the data by using it actively for prevention and early diagnosis, i.e.
personalized alerts and recommendations, by deriving lifestyle patterns and trends, and detecting
anomalies
providing more intuitive, dynamic dashboards that provide actionable insights, i.e.
significant deviations from observed normal behavior

affecting millions of people worldwide. The primary goal of osteoporosis treatment should be fracture prevention and non-
pharmacological strategies such as diet (mainly calcium, vitamin D and protein) and exercise (weight-bearing exercises that
cause force on the bones like jogging, stair climbing or resistance exercises) that can be modified to maintain bone and muscle
health throughout life.
Objectively measured activities using accelerometers are an accurate method for studying relationships between physical
exercise and bone. Recent studies have examined the relationships between levels of vertical impacts associated with exercise
and bone mineral density (BMD) in adolescents or premenopausal women. Taking it together with the fact that the age-related
declines in the intensity and quantity of exercise contribute to the increase in risk of osteoporotic fracture, this lead us to the
necessity to promote physical activity in order to maintain bone mass.
The use of technology to enhance exercise prescription and understanding the optimal exercise type and dose (duration,
frequency and intensity) that have the greatest effect on BMD are common issues that arise. Thus, to address these healthcare
needs, sensors can be integrated into wearable technologies and such, so that health information can be acquired in daily living.
Therefore, our aim is to develop a system able to acquire health information related to osteoporosis and fragility fractures
prevention, detecting accelerations in different activities and also UVB radiation received (important for vitamin D generation) in
order to implement an application that allows immediate feedback to the users, avoiding the lack of motivation.

Consequently, the customer should be rewarded for all such activities, usually through some kind of discount coupons or reward points.

This feature is unique and brings price transparency to the parking market for the first time. ?By using RFID technology in cooperation with car parks, cashless payment and direct access to car parks are possible. That allows us to offer a parking solution to B2B customers that dispose of a vehicle fleet. Providing all cars of a vehicle fleet with an RFID tag, we will drastically reduce accounting costs related to parking since all parking transactions will be automatically billed to one company credit card.ÿ

We shift the focus on functional aspects: how would the design actually work? Currently it often has to be imagined based on textual descriptions. We find that human cognitive capacity is easily too limited to really be able to review the functionality of a complex plan in the mind only. Therefore we plan to offer software tools to support it.

Therefore, anyone with teaching, tutoring, or instructing experience can become a tutor as far as they are currently enrolled in, or have graduated from the same college subject they want to teach.ÿThis benefits all the community members involved.

The positive effects of this connection are numerous: not only do students in need of help become better students, but it encourages studying at all levels, as good students compete to offer the best class.

Technology has been a difficult sell in education. IT has been successful in business because it generally aims to automate work processes. Globally, however, educators do not want to automate education in this way. As such, Ed-Tech that has proven successful in schools has tended to automate administration, rather than educational material, leaving smaller addressable markets open to content creators. ShowMaker hands the production of educational content over to children in the style of a game editor, using a model based on the modding (popular in the games industry).

It is therefore necessary, often mandatory depending on organisation and market, to qualitatively analyze the sensitivity of the staff on the security of the IT system, and give the employees a good training to lead them to responsible behaviors. The management also expects a graduated overview of the maturity of an organisation.
The first stage of the project will be to know the status of each employee regarding IT security. We will measure their awareness through a complete and innovative diagnosis system, based on questions that are directly linked to their work activity. This measurement will be made over three axes: sensitivity, knowledge and behavior. The level of awareness in terms of maturity is evaluated thanks to various themes such as logical access, good practices, legal aspect, e-mail, critical data, customer data, computing and liberties, internet, mobility, multi-function printers.
During the second stage of Digidiag, every employee will receive a targeted digital training. The initial diagnosis will indeed bring to light the various points that are not mastered enough by the employee. This aspect of training is completely innovative, since each employee will be trained on some specific points, which are a function of his/her maturity on IT security.
Finally, a diagnosis of acquired validation will be made to verify the aggregation of all the data learned during the training, and giving final recommendations for the company and each employee.",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

It is fast enough to transmit music over the Internet at best CD quality with a delay overhead of only a few milliseconds. If musicians have a typical broadband Internet connection with a round-trip Internet ping time below 30 ms between them, they can already jam together.

Within this project, we will use FiWare enablers to set up a web based social platform for musicians which will help them to find a nearby playfellow and to connect the Musicboxes to each other, even if they are behind firewalls and NAT routers.

ÿ

Our business model is straight forward. We aim to sell the Musicbox hardware to musicians and people who learn an instrument. In addition, we expect advertisement revenues from the Musicbox social media platform.

ÿ

Our solutions help to connect musicians across Europe who want to jam with their friends without having to go to the rehearsal room or who are just looking for a new fellow musician. It is also good for young musicians who, during their practise, want to get feedback from their teachers.

ÿ

Our company offers a platform to make Car Apps and leverage Big Data without coding skills or expensive investments.

ÿ

PROBLEM: People aiming to develop a Car App have to spend money and time (recruiting developers, learning about frameworks, specific guidelines?). Generic App Builders are not an option for apps that need real-time Car features.

ÿ

OUR PRODUCTS:

- TSD BUILDER: platform specially designed for automotive apps creation. Customers are able to create a Car App just dragging and dropping widgets (gauges, alarms ?) and connecting with Third-party APIs, OBD devices or OpenData.

- TSD CLOUD: TheSuperDriver enables data collection allowing telematics services (remote diagnostics, live tracking, geofences, contextual ads?) and analytics (driver behaviour, predictive demand?).

ÿ

TARGET MARKET: 

- APPS CREATION &amp; MANAGEMENT: SMEs who request Car-Apps (e.g. driving schools, garages, car dealers), app developers (marketers, designers?) and LiveTracking services customers.

-DATA: Data Management Platforms, Insurance companies, MKT Agencies...

ÿ

BUSINESS MODEL: TheSuperDriver uses the successful business models mix from profitable App-Builders companies: - SaaS: client pays a recurring subscription. - DaaS: Data as Service selling - Residual incomes from one time sales, ads, etc.

ÿ

COMPETITORS: generic app builder platforms, new cutting-edge companies working with OBD devices and developing their own APIs and emerging Car frameworks. However, TheSuperDriver will bring to the customer the features of all of them to a vast type of users.

Why it is an innovation for well-being ?

Our aim is to bring assistance to frail people from wherever they may be located, without any need for batteries, excluding the 3G/4G networks and with an affordable price.

How does it workÿ?

Ti'Care has an ON / OFF function and a ""HELP"" button.

In the ON mode, it is possible to localize the person on a remote web server without end-user intervention.
	In the OFF mode, Ti'Care is not connected. However an action on a ""HELP"" button makes it active and visible on a remote web server. This feature allows to trigger assistance on, where the person is located.

Currently, the assembled data is kept in separate silos at many different organisations. The data is being collected, enriched and processed in non-transparent, insecure and untrusted ways, giving only very limited control and value to the prime owners of the data: the individuals. This unbalanced access to and control of the data risks to alienate users and destroy the valuable system.

It has become one of the most important issues in Europe, especially in urban landscape[3]. For this reason, the ?Re-CiTy? media platform offers a novel support for the urban &amp; domestic waste management. ÿThe innovative character of this tool is based on three main pillars: information database, second hand product exchange network and a last minute food trading tool.

ÿ

Information database: It will provide an interactive map of the city which will allow users to find waste collecting points of any kind (e.g. glass, paper, organic, electro domestics, furniture, among others), specially trading points, and the schedule of each one of them.
	Second hand product exchange network: it will provide an easy and direct platform to exchange second hand products among users (by donation, auction or selling). The idea in here is to reuse and to recycle these items. A system of private accounts and real-time notifications will also be provided to users so they know when a new product has been uploaded to the system and how far is it from their position. At the end, it is expect that a large network of local seekers and givers to be created.
	Last Minute Food Trading Tool: In here, food related companies (e.g. supermarkets, minimarkets, bakeries, restaurants, etc) will offer highly competitive discounts on their products (about to expire but in good conditions) to citizens. In one way, food will not be wasted and final users will benefit with large discounts.
ÿ

Thanks to this platform, government (i.e. Municipality) and final end-users (i.e. Citizens) will be able, not only to reduce and properly manage in a more environmentally friendly their wastes, but to benefit from them (i.e. Saving/making money) and also acknowledging the global carbon footprint that has been saved in the city on-real-time due to the use of this tool, improving at the same time sustainable awareness on the population.

What?

ViViVi is a marketplace for customized tours hosted by locals. It aims to connect travellers with hosts in cities worldwide. Travellers can choose from existing options or propose different ones. Local guides offer tours, manage schedules and promote themselves.

ÿ

Why?

Travellers currently have three options for exploring new places: following the herd in a lame group tour, hiring an expensive private guide, or taking the time-consuming risk of planning a tour themselves.

ÿ

We want to create a simple way for travellers to connect with hosts who can provide authentic, affordable and fun local experiences.

ÿ

Local guides do not have the marketing skills and power to promote themselves on a global level, especially when it is an after work activity to earn a bit of extra money.

ÿ

ÿ

Who?

ÿ

Travellers, local guides at the initial stage

ÿ

Tourist offices, event organisers, tour guide agencies, conference organisers in a second stage

ÿ

Where?

ÿ

3 countries (France, Spain, Italy) at first and then all countries offering world heritage and cultural tours.

ÿ

When?

ÿ

To be launched in the first quarter of 2016.

ÿ

How?

ÿ

4 main technical assets to be developed:

A web site enabling travellers to view available tours: duration, cost, reviews of local guides, schedules, communication interface
	A mobile application offering the same services as the web site, plus geolocalization
	A ?public? back office where local guides can propose tours, manage their costs and their schedules as well as promote themselves.
	A ?company? back office enabling us to manage all the relevant activities.
ÿ

How much? 

ÿ

Phocuswrightÿestimates that US travellers spend over $26 billion per year on tours and activities. With the addition of European and Asian travellers, the global figure is therefore higher. Setting these figures against people that use mobile technologies when travelling leaves enough room for a real market to be addressed.

ÿ

Our differentiation?

ÿ

We already own a database of 4,500 audioguided multilingual tours around the world (www.zevisit.com), which can be offered as an alternative to local guides. Hence, the platform will offer real content from the very first day.

We are all road users, if not car drivers then at least cyclists or pedestrians, riding or walking along or across streets. It is therefore in our best interest that these roads and sidewalks are kept safe and comfortable.

The reality, however, is that the urban infrastructure ages and deteriorates fast.

By neglecting repairs or failing to carry them out properly, roads quickly turn into hole-ridden traps. A key factor to properly repairing or servicing roads is response time; repairs carried out at an early stadium (as soon as the defect surfaces) can be even 5 times less expensive than those typically delayed for 30-60 days. It is also imperative to use the latest technologies which enable quick, effective and lasting road repair at relatively low cost.

Our intention is to create a platform where road users may expose and report potholes on a massive scale to road administrators and the authorities responsible for their repair. At the same time, accumulating large amounts of reliable data about potholes will enable the authorities to manage the problem thanks to our workflow solution. By making this information public, we will put social pressure on the decision-makers to take considerably more effective approach to road repairs. The platform will furthermore enable the community of road users to instantly file claims against administrators for compensation and restitution due to damages or injuries caused by potholes.

it improves the networking experience and ensures delegates will re-attend. Plus,
 by providing deep 
insight into the networking activity they have the ability to i
mprove their event. 
fuseami has been rolled out to events on a trial basis since March 2015. Th
e adoption to date has 
been impressive with conferences across the globe choosing to use fuseami to 
improve the 
networking at their events. 11 successful trials have been run, with another 17 
future events 
confirmed, incl the European Commission's  ICT2015 event in Oct

 is an innovative navigation system designed to guide visually impaired people in public spaces and increase their
autonomy and independence. 
Social inclusion
 of blind greatly improves by enhancing  their mobility and autonomous life,
factors that are a basis for their active involvement in the society. The challenge we are facing is to strengthen people?s current
and future capacities, and improve their well being and providing more opportunities to participate in society and the labor
market.
Arianna
 uses commercial smartphones to provide 
high precision localization services
 against a simple and cheap
infrastructure composed of colored paths painted or stuck on the floor (much cheaper than tactile pavements). Through special
vibrational signals the user receives feedback for correcting his/her direction. Landmarks can be deployed along the path for
coding additional information. Arianna will provide also an SDK and we will build an 
open platform
 for all people willing to
develop location-based services dedicated to visually impaired people, creating a community of people sharing the same
mission and contributing to the success of the project. Arianna fits into the market of pedestrian navigation, which according to
all analysts is booming, with an 
annual
increase rate of about 50%
 until 2020. Despite the interest of several big players in this
market, there is a lack of attention to users with visual impairments. Arianna is aimed at this group of users, excluded from mass
products, through the presence in public places (such as hospitals, airports, stations, museums) where accessibility for blind
people is more important.
With Arianna and its community platform, the idea is to make these places ?smarter?, allowing a 
better quality of life
 for visually
impaired all-over Europe and possibly in the world.

Demands for transparency are increasing. Transparency is no longer confined to traceability and food safety, but includes ethical, environmental and governance issues. Retail today demands more accurate and faster information, requesting real-time data before trade transactions even take place. This shift from trust-based to proof-based chain relationships is notable in all aspects of trade and requires digitalization and data management on farm.

Farms are faced with these information requirements from different importers, using a great variety in forms and formats. Although these forms and formats cover similar issues and ask for the same pieces of evidence, standardisation in data gathering is limited. Farm level data is often entered multiple times. Collected data resides with consultants, auditors, importers or traders and data re-use is minimal. Limited data standardization and poor data management on farms result in high transaction costs for farmers, auditors, importers, retail and the consumer.

ÿ

A cooperative platform where farmers collect, own, use and re-use data for sustainable production 

Different transparency requirements of consumers, standard-setting organizations and buyers need further standardization, thereby facilitating more effective farm data collection and management. AgriPlace offers a solution. AgriPlace is a service for farmers to collect, improve and share data to respond to broader transparency demands, including all aspects of sustainable production. Agri and food companies, retailers, importers and others will use AgriPlace to get direct access to reliable and accurate farm data, with permission of the farmer. AgriPlace makes data entry easy for farmers with a clear and simple user interface. It identifies data overlap between information requirements and facilitates re-use. By working with auditors and standard setting bodies, the platform improves harmonization of sustainability data and existing verification processes. Farmers will get more control over their own business data. Compliance will become easier and more cost-effective across the value chain. Administrative burdens will be reduced and chain transparency will increase for buyers and consumers.

We noticed a great demand and interest on the subject and the program presented. Interest to the point that already two companies committed themselves to the project and more who want to commit when the see the results.

ÿ

After years of hard work the partnership is ready to launch the app. The market is eagerly waiting for this application, as will be discussed in detail further at section (5.2.2.3). The goal is for Waste watcher to become the leading monitor of food waste in the Netherlands. First we will implement the application in the professional food market. With these we gather data and paying customer to become a self sustaining business. After that we start with the second step implementation of a waste reduction application to the public market. The goals and how we will reach them will be discussed further in section 5.2.2.3. For the application to be successful there needs to be a start view to get (XXX) the application running and data collected. The partner already invested in the development of the application (see 3.). Further we present a budget (5.3) and we present expected results.ÿ

The application development aims two user modes:
1.	solution developed only for SmartPhone (SMS-based),
2.	solution for SmartPhone-server connection (3G, 4G data distribution)

1 The standalone application for SmartPhones is working on mobile devices uploaded and provided with the up-to-date data of the cities? parking zones and parking meters. Having the disadvantage that only one city/zone/country data are applicable. Data actualization is possible only with live internet connection. The app is capable for use without an uploaded database; in this case user shall drive to the parking meter (for the first ID scanning, in every zone) ? and this is even much more convenient than traditional SMS-based solutions.
2 On a higher level, we use mobile phones for measure and data collection, all other functions are provided by a central server. As a server operation, we can make a choice between several functions. In a most complex case, the driver defines the address (or vicinity) where he/she intends to park. The centre evaluates the vehicle position and possible parking places, then makes and sends a suggestion to the driver. In case of multi-users, the system is capable of forecasting fullness; showing closest parking place with most free places. In large events, we can redirect cars to the closest parking places.
Mobile app can be started at the moment of parking. Mobile device reads GPS coordinates, then sends this information to a server, where coordinates will be validated by the mobile towers. Server sends the information about the parking zone where we stopped.
Huge advantage of the server solution is that we are capable of sending actual traffic information to the car driver (if access is provided to those data), so we can inform drivers about temporary parking bans, closed roads or evacuations, etc.
If the vehicle is parking in a controlled (fee) parking zone, the following pre-defined data can be modified on the mobile phone:
?	registration number
?	defined fix parking time, or prolonged paying until stop sign
?	automatic prolongation after fix time ? or no prolongation.
The app sends the answers to the server, where the data file for pay start is assembled and communicated to the parking company?s system.
The confirmatory SMS is verified by the app:
?	In normal case, affirms the pay start.
?	In case of a disabled (faulty) parking system, alerts the driver.
In case of a fix or maximized parking time, if no automatic prolongation is defined, the app alerts driver before time expiration. The driver has the possibility to leave or to restart payment request.
If driver defines continued parking, and in interruption, the driver shall select the applicable function on his SmartPhone. In this case, the confirmation is also processed:
?	In lowered SMS-mode, if no stop-confirmation was sent, alerts the car driver.
?	Parking fees are collected in a separate database, and this database is queried at a later time.
In both modes, and in free parking zones a useful function is applicable: support for finding parking car: based on coordinates registered at stop, the app marks the location of car on the map.
Advantages of Pay-by-Phone Parking system:
?	useful for the parking company: cheap maintenance (less parking meter needed);
?	useful for the car drivers: no more risk of time expiration, shorter time  to pay as for a parking meter. The parking zones borders are more easily defined by GPS and a database, than the public places do (with painted marks and signposts). Disadvantage: transactional fees for drivers. In solutions based on data traffic, the SMS charges are saved.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

We have currently built an elementary module for data analytics which aggregates feeds from multiple sensors to single user-friendly interface enabling potential applications for doctors and therapists to analyze patients? activities and changes in their conditions and trends. Future plans include automatic alerts and recommendations based on thresholds and trend variations.

End users (medical professionals, caregivers and patients) can access the health information using internet enabled devices like smartphones, tablets, computers through our web interface.

We also have the capabilities to interface with customer's HIS (through an API).

Step 2
Access to health trends information makes it easier for the medical professional to assess different diagnosis. The interface will be designed with fields and tools relevant to tracking the specific diagnosis and helping the medical professionals to manage and provision different diagnosis easier.

To improve the service, automatic health data monitoring solutions, workflow optimization and information management between different actors is needed. Therefore we have focused on platform -centric approach connecting diagnostics, assessment, treatments and monitoring. So we see the need for specialized aggregating service with a focused approach connecting with domain specific assessment and treatment plans.

The sci-fi theme has been very successful in the past and still is, on platforms other than mobile. Cartoonish graphics are a marketing innovation which exploded with mobile devices and is connected to casual playing for all ages. But market research shows that not all players are casual. And most players are above 35 years old. While keeping the mechanics simple to appeal to the masses, a slightly more targeted and mature product can yield millions of loyal players also on tablets. To reduce the risk (and avoid reinventing the wheel), we are basing the game monetisation logic and most of the game mechanics on the very best existing titles ? notably Supercell?s Boom Beach (a game grossing several hundred thousand dollars...per day). But the improvements even over this top titles will be substantial (also to make up for the lower marketing budget at our disposal, vis-a-vis the larger gaming software houses). Most gaming software houses produce tens of mediocre, simple games in the attempt to spread the net as wide as possible and catch many users with ""low risk"". Soon, they are forced to produce new games and pump up marketing budgets as players rapidly abandon their games. The best gaming software houses produce very few games, but work to deliver top quality and create a loyal, self-sustaining community.

Also, Questmeter bounds social actors each other via approval competition and self improvement while the features such as media galleries, friendships, chat making Questpeople social more than any other question-answer websites.

Proposition 2-) Users pick their interests via channels besides following any channels belonging to anyone. A mother quests for a cooking recipe with her close friends whereas a CEO quests for the market analysis with global connections.

Proposition 3-) Just as invention of ?tweet? gave a new impulse to learning concept, we do this in a different way via ?quest?. An academic question like ?What is gini coefficient? or thousand year old question like ?do all men cheat? can be a quest. In future, with our mobile application ?Where is the nearest open pharmacy? can be a quest in order to fulfil urgent needs. You can form quests via videos or audios. You can challange, you can ask or share via quests. Quest is the most social way of asking.

Proposition 4-) Learning and socializing must be considered together as their nature. Universities can apply us to get a personalized platform in Questpeople where their lecturers and students, graduates can interact effectively via class filters.

Regions can be nested, one region is part of another region
- Micro regions: small outlet based regions, indoor and outdoor in meters (< 100 meter normally)
ibeacons are used for micro region
- Multiple ibecaons can extend the same micro region: 2 entrances in the same building
- Multiple micro regions in one store, consisting of multiple ibeacons
Each ibeacon has a unique ID (UUid) or multiple ibeacons share the same.
We connect one or more ibeacon UUID with local business.

Web-Caisse is a Saas Point of Sales (POS). This software is the first SaaS system in France which obtained a certification by the LNE (Laboratoire National de m‚trolodie et d?Essais) for its connected balances.
Web-Caisse manage products by category, providers, sales with statistics, stocks, inventories, orders etc and above all to monitor his activity anytime and anywhere. Web-Caisse is adaptable and customizable according to the activity.
It is designed to convenience stores, to gain time during the cashing in order to according more time to the customer and improve the customer relationship.
Fid?Elite is complementary to Web-Caisse. Fid?Elite offers to convenience stores the possibility to build a customer database and to exploit it with relevance. The seller can manage commercial actions, to segment clients, to communicate with customers via emailing or SMS etc.
The idea is to complete these software?s with ApiBroker. 

Phase 1
The ApiBroker is an application designed for convenience stores, which are using our software Web-Caisse, and/or Fid?Elite in order to dynamize and optimize sales between shops and their customers.
Firstly, the aim is to connect sellers with buyers. The seller can communicate special offers or place bids on products with a validity period to stimulate impulse buying. The customer, receive a notification and can buy the product if it is a special offer or propose a bid price. The highest bidder will get the product. These actions will incite customers to visit the store to see the product and to buy. It?ll permits to the seller to increase the frequenting in his store and maybe the customer will buy other products.
The aim is to connect shops? offers for their products with prices? offers of customers. In this way, the seller will obtain the better selling price and the customer will obtain the better purchase price. Through this application, sellers will be able to attract new customers.

Phase 2
In a second time, the application?ll presents two platforms. The backoffice for sellers and the frontoffice for buyers. Sellers will define their terms, for example minimum sale price, maximum quantities etc. On the other side, the customers will inquire several criteria for example his preference, contact information etc. His criteria will?nt be visible to the seller but nevertheless he can use them, that will allows the seller to target customers.
In this phase, ApiBroker put in competition several shops.
From the backoffice, the seller can see auctions? customers but can?t see others sellers. The customer is connected to the frontoffice and can see several sellers to choose the best offer. ApiBroker permits to the seller to broaden the spectrum of its customers, his catchman area. The seller can use several means such as the geolocalization, a smartphone application etc. Actions are done in real time, that encourages interactions. The customer has more choices, more offers and can inquire several cretaria to receive notifications.

The products have different features: quantity, price and location to be filtered.
A subscription and management merchants module will also be integrated into this interface in order to sellers can register on the application and manage their products. These sellers will initially users of products developed by Apitic: Web-Caisse and / or Fid'Elite.

It will eliminate the transaction inefficiencies in the traditional trade process of Solar Power Purchase Agreements (SPPA) and Solar Leases (SL), enabling a win-win condition both for Solar Services Providers and for Rooftop Owners. 
SPPA and SL are contracts between a ?Solar Services Provider? who owns, utilizes, and maintains the photovoltaic project, and a ?Rooftop Owner? who delivers a designated location for the solar installation such as an unutilized rooftop.  
In a SPPA, the Rooftop Owner agrees to purchase the energy output from the developer at a fixed price for a prearranged time period. In a Solar Lease, instead, the Rooftop Owner rents the solar equipment against a monthly remittance. In either cases, the Rooftop Owner is able to slash down his energy expenses drastically and notice long-term savings as current grid-electricity prices continue to increase. The Solar Services Provider pays for all the installation costs and is held responsible for the operation and maintenance of the project.
This framework is referred to as the ""solar as a service"" model, and enable the host customer to avoid many of the traditional barriers to adoption for organizations looking to install solar systems: high up-front capital costs; system performance risk; and complex design and permitting processes. In addition, these arrangements can be cash flow positive for the host customer from the day the system is commissioned.
With SunnyRev, Rooftop Owners will be able to minimize the solar rate and maximize their savings by putting Producers in competition for their rooftops with a reverse auction mechanism. Bidding performed in real-time via the Internet will result in a dynamic, competitive process. This will help achieve rapid downward price pressure (energy price or lease remittance, depending of the case)  that is not normally attainable using traditional static paper-based bidding processes. At the same time, Producers will reduce costs and timing for acquiring new clients.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

Gigdiving helps solve the problem of the ?disconnect? between artists, promoters and fans by flipping the live event industry around. By using crowdsourcing method, Gigdiving removes the risk factor from the live performance industry and empowers fans throughout the process. Gigdiving will not only be a ticket-presale platform, but will also serve as an innovative music fan club for and by music aficionados. It creates a social and engaging experience for music fans to interact and share insights and ideas, while helping their favourite artists? realize a tour. 

On Gigdiving, fans can pledge to buy tickets to see their favourite artist in their city of choice. When a fan pledges to buy a ticket, this means that he/she is genuinely interested in seeing the artist and will show up at the gig. This will provide the artists and promoters with valuable real time information about where to go and how many people will come. It also means artists get guaranteed funding before the tour.

Product/service introduction:
If an artist with a GigDiving profile has opened a campaign, Fans may offer to purchase a number of tickets for this performance at a ticket price set by you (?Pledging?). 
After the artist sets the ticket price your pledged tickets will be automatically purchased if:
-	Fan's set ticket price is higher than the ticket price set by the artist, fan will pay the ticket price as set by the artist;
-	Fan's set ticket price is equal to the ticket price set by the artist;
-	Fan's set ticket price is higher than the ticket price set by the artist, but fan has chosen to be a ?Superfan?: you will pay the higher ticket price.

The pledged tickets will not be purchased automatically if your set ticket price is lower than the ticket price set by the artist.

GigDiving is taking a fan-driven approach to the music and concert industry. It also gives artists the flexibility and freedom to manage their own tour. This approach puts all the power in the hands of artists and their fans, keeping the Indie music industry truly independent. With the help of sharing/on-demand services like AirBnB, CouchSurfing and Uber, travel costs are kept to a minimum and tour arrangement will be hassle-free. And through established, professional services and tools like ReverbNation, musicians can find promoters and venues for themselves. 

GigDiving gives musicians and their fans the opportunity to use whichever technology is available to truly stay independent and still travel to perform. With Tourje and an open mind, performing in any corner of the world will no longer be a dream.",Service provider,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,Marketing,Applications,Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Applications,1,0,0,Startup,0,gigdiving.com

IungoSUPPLIER supports the scheduling by priority of the delivery of goods and the related production orders.
IungoSUPPLIER prototype is already validated in operational environment, but it was installed in a dedicated web server of the IT infrastructure of each supplier. The real business idea is to deploy IungoSUPPLIER as a web based service centre adopting FI-WARE infrastructure and related technologies.
In particular IungoSUPPLIER can: 	
- send documents to external / internal partners through various communication channels, according to the partner preferences (for example IUNGOmail, EDI, Web-portal, pdf, fax, ...); 
- control the document life cycle according to a pre-defined workflow;  
 - monitor the status of active documents highlighting any changes or anomalies; 
 - support users? work to solve critical situations; 
- log all the occurred events and all the exchanged documents.
The basic elements in IungoSUPPLIER are:
- documents: elements (text or image) containing information at multiple levels (head of the order, order line, scheduling - delivery locations);
- workflow: set of states that can assume each document;
- users: person and/or customised plug-in that, according to permissions, can generate actions or change information related to any document according to a defined workflow;
- company: logical container of documents.
In general:
- each type of document is associated to a workflow, which describes its life cycle;
 - the same workflow can be used by different types of documents;
- each user is associated to one or more ?roles? (a coherent set of permissions) for each company;

Because of the counting of reps, we can make sure that the user really makes all the exercises that he decided to do in his training plan. This is very important to see real progress.

The product/service is essentially a software package that runs on computers, smartphones and tablets of the private people and bus drivers, and the server-side software that does the information exchange, optimal route planning, demand forecasting, and bookkeeping.

b) Transportation from door to door individually by taxis
Texo competes by considering the wishes of multiple/many travellers and by generating dynamic routes for the transportation vehicles. Texo collects peoples? wishes for commuting, combines the routes and finds the most optimal solution for transportation (better price than taxi and faster than bus). 

The client enters the commute wish into the system and gets offered a solution that considers which Texo could fulfill the need most optimally - considering also the movements of other clients.

-	Access to personalized promotions and campaigns, both geo-located in the shopping center. The mall can be signposted so well located spots can recognized the presence of users and target customized promotions and discounts using the APP installed in the user?s devices.
-	Buying and paying using the mobile phone and picking up the delivery in the stores, saving queues and time.
In fact, the system is a centralized search engine of products available in the different shops in the shopping centers that combines the searching with personalized promotions and advertisement according the customer profile. The personalization will be achieved by means of traditional loyalty campaigns where the mobile app becomes a loyalty card and the system can access to the historical shopping list. The personalization can be increased if customer enables the use of their public Facebook profile.
This functionality is supported by means of an indoor localization system. The system locates smartphones in a local area through the installation of cheap wireless signs. This enables the push notification of personalized promotions of the nearest shops directly in the customer smartphone. In addition to this personalized advertisement, the customer will be able to directly buy and pay with his smartphone, and decides if he goes to the shop to pick up his order or the buy is sent to his home.
The system offers a backend with two profiles. A super user for the shopping center administrators, that control the credentials of the other users (shops administrators), loyalty programs, locations, etc and the privilege users (shopping administrators) that controls the update of their products lists and can controls their particular promotions.

We build an Online Live Video Chat platform, where millions of customers talk with thousands of Psychological Professionals face-to-face for mental health care, from the comfort & privacy of home! 

How it works:

o      A Psychological Professional sits in front of the webcam at home or office, talking to multiple Customers at the same time for FREE in the PUBLIC chat room. Customers can see and hear the Professionals in real time. Customers can also see the Professionals? profiles, such as years of experience, qualification, specialty, language skills, self introduction, price, etc. 

o	Customers arrive at PsychAsk.com by clicking on our ad campaigns on Google Ads / Facebook / Twitter. On arrival, they can immediately start interacting with the Professional they choose, asking about their emotional problems in relationship, career, health, family, sex, etc. Because Customers can see and hear the Professional in real, they can evaluate if they feel emotionally connected with the particular Professional or not. Customers can also find out if the Professional is qualified enough to help with their emotional problems. 

o	In the PUBLIC chat room, a Professional can?t pay exclusive attention to one single Customer. So if a Customer decides to talk with a Professional in PRIVATE exclusively about his personal problems, because nobody wants to share their privacy in front the public, he can immediately go into a PAID 1-on-1 session with the Professional by clicking one button. The price is pre-set by the Professional. 

o	PsychAsk.com takes a 30% commission from the PAID private session, and doesn?t charge Professionals or Customers anything else.",Service provider,0,0,X,0,0,0,,0,Conferencing Applications,Applications,Collaborative Applications,1,0,0,Startup,0,PsychAsk.com

Unlike conventional ratings reports, new audience measurement technologies enable network operators, programmers and advertisers to calculate and report real-time viewing metrics based on actual pay TV usage.  Instead of relying on small panels or samples of TV viewers, the new methods allow operators to collect and aggregate comprehensive usage viewing data from all viewers by leveraging digital set-top boxes in new and improved ways. Specifically, these software technologies collect real-time, second-by-second click streams from three basic sources -- real-time viewing (linear broadcast and switched digital video, or SDV), on-demand viewing (VOD and DVRs) and interactive engagements (interactive TV programming, tru2way applications and Embedded TV Binary Interchange Format, or EBIF, features). For instance, an SDV manager can collect the linear broadcast and switched digital tuning data while an EBIF/application server gathers the critical set-top box data and a VOD server would collect all on-demand purchases. With tools to collect real-time click stream data, network operators can send all the information to data warehouses for storage, reports and analytics. They can send transactional data, such as VOD purchases, to their billing systems for processing, as well as collect and store ad placement data from the ad servers in the data warehouses for reporting and analytics, providing key visibility into the viewership of specific ads. Unlike traditional ratings reports, the new audience measurement techniques by Broacastrack will also track viewing well beyond the traditional TV environment. They can not only measure conventional, linear TV viewing, but also on-demand, streaming media, online and mobile video consumption These attributes make the new techniques a crucial element for the emerging three-screen video universe.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

Therefore we encompass entrepreneurs and people with entrepreneurial spirit; experience in web and technical development including FiWare; experience in project execution, business development and commercial management; experience in the book-editorial and logistic sector; experience in marketing and communication; and of course, with great love for literature.

PAPELclub is as a gamified vertical platform focused on the literature ecosystem. It materializes in a web platform and mobile apps accessible for every person who love to read.
It will provide support to the kind of dynamics that occur in a readers-club like publication of events and news, groups and member management and attendance, get to know your local community of writers, recommendations and debates of authors and books, or an optimal sharing of books across members and friends.

We have built off-line prototypes and test most crucial aspects like monetization with several success cases. Now it is time to develop the technical solution, and for this venture we decide to build it within FiWare technology as our philosophy goes in accordance with open-data and smart-cities initiatives.

This is a cultural project, but is also an economic viable one. For our support we get revenues by optimizing existing activities and provide higher value to our users; more optimal and higher visibility. For the community, we help empowering the local actors like writers, authors, event organizers and reading-clubs, and set them closer to their public: the book lovers: our users.

We called it ""Cityfunding"", an innovative concept that combines the city - its people, spaces, resources, and dynamics - with the potential of crowdfunding, a widespread and ever growing system that allows ideas to become real thanks to small contributions coming from a large number of players.

We believe that in the present circumstances of crisis - scarcity of significant public and private investment for improving the quality of urban life - a bottom-up and incremental approach to city-making represents a reliable alternative to the current planning process, often slow and ineffective in the mid and short term. The intelligence of the crowd turns to be a key ingredient to deal with such fragile situation.

Cityfunding aims to create the essential conditions for developing small, temporary projects on the city. This is achieved by making useful information about existing / potential opportunities, accessible and interactive. Users can take advantage of this knowledge to build local networks around their ideas and collect the needed resources. Cityfunding is a crowdfunding platform attached to real places.

Digital and physical space are integrated in a hybrid system, where real markers placed in the city complement the online tool for networking and crowdsourcing.

In the recent years, we have been specialized in the research and development of a solution for the work shift assignments problem. We have focused this research in an important algorithmic study for the resolution of this type of problems, which are classified as a NP-complete problem. At the same time, we have developed Cloud Technology components like a task dispatcher and an auto-learning system to improve the user experience and the innovation component. PGPlanning software arise from all this work, as a base for the development of a specific solution to solve the work shift assignment problematic of different sectors. Our project presents the solution PGPlanning Police, a specific development to solve the Police shift assignment problem. This project stems from the interest shown by our customers (Local Government) and its needs to solve their work shift scheduling problem.

At this point, based on our acquired knowledge and our intelligent engine already developed, we propose the development of this project adding the FIWARE technology.

From the beginning, our product is developed with open standards and open source technologies. In addition, the production infrastructure is based also in open source technologies. This is why we think that FIWARE meets all of our requirements to be integrated in our product.

From then on we have created a work team with the necessary technical skills and accumulated experience to accomplish all the project objectives minimizing the potential risks.

Retailers and department stores are some of the entities that actually contribute to this by means of aggressive promotions, loyalty cards, promotional coupons, mailbox marketing, and mailing list advertising. These marketing stunts give families a chance to find the best deals and make the most of their budgets. Unfortunately, they are largely ineffective if people just can?t put the necessary time and effort into it. 
SmartBY wants to become the leading app for managing and sharing shopping lists among the members of a family and, at the same time, provide a shopping plan to each user for its shopping lists. This plan allows families to have a preview of their overall spending needs and better plan the use of their budget. SmartBY takes into consideration the prices on physical stores, the localization of its users, and the days in which products will be on Sale to create a shopping plan that identifies who, when and where should buy the items on the list in order to maximize savings.
There are several mobile apps for helping families organize their shopping list of groceries and home needs. What these app don?t offer is a way of getting a price tag of each item or for the complete list. They also don?t say in which shops people can find the products on their list.

With the project, VES aims to create synergies between electricity, heating/cooling and final applications, via its proprietary web-based Residential Energy Management System ""REMS-soft"". REMS-soft is an open-source Cloud-based Energy Management architecture, able to connect to any type of energy sensor of building energy device. REMS-soft uses energy data from any energy sensor technology, and translates it into one open-source architecture. A common open-source architecture is key to optimize the energy systems at different levels: individual building, community, city, region. 

Currently energy data in Smart Cities is dispersed, non-integrated and generated by heterogeneous sensors. Sensors in building electric devices (e.g. electric meters, heat pumps,?) use different communication technologies, are not-compatible and non-integrated, which creates a problem to use, analyze, and optimize energy data even at individual building level. 

REMS-soft provides a modular solution, as it can be installed in one single building at a time. As the installed base (also of similar open-source softwares) grows, compatible energy data can be analyzed to optimize the energy system.

Starting from this consideration, several models with different levels of sophistication have been defined to assess urban air quality and support decision making for pollution control strategies and traffic planning. However, what is lacking is a tool for estimating and forecasting the air quality level, depending on changing traffic conditions. The latter are in turn dependent on citizens? behavior (mobility behavior), which may vary in time and space. 
The keyword of our project is then ?adaptive simulation?: a mobility behavior affects the traffic morphology (in time and space), and eventually the air pollution level and its distribution. An adaptive simulation tool can interact with this variety of behavior classes, by translating them in different pollution sources, geo-located on the city map and corresponding to different pollution peaks. 
A Local Government can use this tool to produce different scenarios and then suggest to citizens a series of improving behaviors, also modulating such suggestions according to estimated extreme/critical events (particular meteorological events, critical road works, scheduled social events, etc.) 
On the other hand, the Citizen can play with this application to learn how a different behavior can affect the pollution level of his/her city.

The current market is super complicated and dominated by solutions involving sensors buried in the ground linked to traffic management systems. On one hand this is logical because City wide problems have always been viewed from an industrial viewpoint solved by industrial partners.
But this is a different era. Simplification of hardware solutions has encouraged a community of makers to innovate using low cost components typified by the Arduino and raspberry-pi, and to raise funds independently using crowd-funding.

The ParkShark Street cam is a fully thought through solution which uses Computer Vision to make a smart prediction of parking space availability in urban areas.   The algorithm will be kept a trade secret but the method could be used to enhance any situation where a vehicle or fleet of vehicles needs to park in areas of limited availability such as Urban delivery places or areas designated for overnight sleeping for truck drivers.

Today this task is carried out in most cases manually by operators acting for private companies, severely limiting the amount of data that can be actually produced with a typical budget. For instance, the UKDepartment for Transport carry out each year traffic counts from about 8.000 locations, where each site is counted on one single day in that year for a twelve hours period (http://goo.gl/cxxglb). It is obvious how the proposed automatic system could improve on the time each site is analyzed.   
The intended business model is to sell the service to professionals like city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers, who typically requires traffic flow data to conduct a variety of planning and operational activities. 
The approach could be further expanded to include other types of video analytics in the future, for instance extracting information from people moving in large public places, a topic that is still currently actively researched in the computer vision community. On similar lines, other type of streaming media could be connected to the platform, such as audio sensors. 
As a final note, we would like to point that this is not a project for building a video surveillance network: we will take in great care of the people's privacy, and all the information extracted by the system will be fully and completely anonymized.",Tech provider,X,X,0,0,X,0,,Software,Spatial Information Management Software,Application Development & Deployment,"Data Access, Analysis, and Delivery Software",1 and 3,X,0,SME,85000,magentalab.it

Kiunsys wants to offer the first connected mobility platform overcoming the fragmentation of the existing silos systems, hardware and software, for urban mobility services, and supporting the integration of multiple applications, to deliver integrated, more effective and higher quality services. Our core platform, INES Cloud, is already able to connect to many urban road infrastructures (i.e. parking sensors, LTZ gates, VMS, etc.) managing a huge amount of data and processes, however it still needs to enhance some key aspects for reaching its goal: embracing open standards for interfacing more third party systems so opening the product to future technological evolutions towards the IoT and Big Data.
Thus our objective is to exploit some of the FI-WARE GEs to add new key features and services to INES Cloud, to become the one stop solution for managing all the operations related to mobility, parking and city logistics in cities of any size.
The idea is to greatly improve INES Cloud along two directions:
1)	To evaluate and later integrate one or more of the 4 Backend Device Management GEs (NEC IoT Broker Configuration Manager, Orion Context Broker, Backend Device Management ? IDAS, Configuration Manager - IoT Discovery). This will enhance the INES connection with the IoT world in a more radical way, by supporting more standardized and easier interfaces to on field urban devices (sensor, actuators and related gateways) for devices management, acquisition of data streaming, data elaboration and actions triggering; 
2)	To integrate PROTON CEP GE (Complex Event Processing).

Market is mainly driven by the increased demand in multimodal interfaces and mobile access: digitalization of working procedures and natural language interaction with the internet are the new challenges for the next years. In this way, the FI-Dict2me platform suppose an innovative  step ahead to provide the European Public Administration (and end-users, that is, citizens)  with an easier, reliable and cost-effective service that allows information retrieval from the public data resident in the FIWARE ecosystem.

Current ICT ecosystem is centred on platforms, applications, and data within the Internet making hardware/packaged?software obsolete. However, the type of interaction with services running on a range of different devices is not appropriate to and compatible with the experience of ease, comfort and concentration people like to enjoy. Although important multi-modal interaction research efforts have been carried out during the last decade, a definitive solution has not been proposed to the industry yet.

- Safety and Security Concerns
- Congestion and Air Pollution
- Inadequate Information;
- Inadequate Urban Environment and Design; 
- Lack of Infrastructure and Support
- Insufficient provision and maintenance of cycle lanes, walking paths, cycle parking and inter-changes with other    transport modes.
- Poor Public Perception and Lack of Awareness
- Accessibility and Health Issues
- Lack of Public Sector Support
- Lack of Education and Training

The entire platform operation is based on the principle of immediacy: once information regarding the request is provided, the system instantly forwards push notifications to compatible workers, who can point out their availability and negotiate the payment required in a simple screen; the employer now will only have to choose the user with whom to conclude the agreement. Thanks to the mobile-based approach, the match among the users only needs a few minutes, in order to meet every need in record time.

Skilled?s first target market will be the Italian one, of which market data refer that youth unemployment rate has exceeded a record level of 40%, with peaks of over 50% in the South; in subsequent years, however, the app will be launched on foreign markets, with significant implications in terms of expansion of the user base. It is estimated that the potential pool of users is made up of approximately 10 million users in Italyand more than 100 million users in Europe.

In July 2014, the project won the competition for innovative business projects of Working Capital (a competition conceived and promoted by Telecom Italia). Among 1,300 projects submitted, Skilled has been selected among the best 40 ones and the company then won a grant of ? 25K and an acceleration period of four months at the accelerator Working Capital of Catania.
In October 2014, the project won the special prize for ICT projects of the Start Cup of University of Messina (business plan competition organized by the University of Messina), comprising ? 2K and admission to the competition Start Cup Sicily.",Service provider,X,0,0,X,X,0,,Software,Advanced and Predictive Analytics Software,Application Development & Deployment,"Data Access, Analysis, and Delivery Software",1,X,0,Other,10000,skilledapp.com

This trend is great news for most of us aspiring to live in smarter and greener cities. Unfortunately, many neighborhoods are not safe and convenient for cycling. Tragedies are often reported in the news such as last November when six cyclists were killed in 13 days in London. 

One of the problems with most biking directions applications is that you are never entirely sure how safe the biking route is before setting off. For instance, many of these applications usually suggests roads you would never consider cycling on and ignores far safer and quieter roads. We propose a solution to address this issue by allowing anyone to preview they cycling rides from the safety of their homes. 

Cyclodeo is a dynamic website that synchronizes Maps, GPS tracks and cycling videos in one page . When a ?Cyclodeo ride? is being replayed, a moving mark is highlighted on the map to indicate the current location of the viewed video. Since each section of the video is geo-coded, you can click anywhere on the cycling track to visualize a specific location from a cyclist?s perspective.  When a city is covered, it allows anyone to see exactly what street conditions they might encounter on a particular cycling ride. We intend to introduce the service in more European cities for the benefit of their citizens.

In the end, the Cyclodeo platform can assist in: 

1) Monitoring the bicycle traffic and identifying dangerous sections of the road network.
2) Classifying cycling paths based on their type and comfort. 
3) Highlighting infrastructure quality for Transport Planners and showcasing infrastructure improvements. 
4) Complementing existing awareness tools used and enhancing its profile to a larger audience through social media. 
5)Showcasing picturesque cycle routes, supporting tourism marketing initiatives as well as encouraging cycling in and around tourism venues/areas.",Service provider,X,0,X,0,X,0,,Software,Spatial Information Management Software,Application Development & Deployment,"Data Access, Analysis, and Delivery Software",1 and 3,X,0,SME,68650,cyclodeo.com

After speaking with key players in the tourism sector - including the President of the Portuguese Tourism Entity and with the National Secretary of State of Tourism in Portugal, we understood a big market necessity which is the lack of relevant tourism statistics and metrics in real-time. Our project aims to build an easy-to-use and intuitive cloud-application - a dashboard - that shows optimization tips to businesses owners. This dashboard is aimed to help tourism businesses to contextualize their performance in a geographic region, access activity predictions and the tourist demand profile. Our customers will be hotels, travel agencies, tour operators, regional and national tourism boards, tourism sector associations, municipalities and other tourism businesses. We are building a cutting edge platform based on the latest technologies and we want to leverage open-source tools in order to build a cloud based platform capable of collecting big amount of data from different sources, perform data analysis through our proprietary algorithms and provide business and tourism insights in an online dashboard with easy and intuitive interfaces. We have been working full time on this project for six months so far. This project was born at the Startup Weekend Viseu, an entrepreneurship contest in which Trip Dashboard was the winner. Before the founders have met, Mario was running another startup and Luis had just quit his corporate job to create his own project. Both wanted to create something technological and disruptive and for that reason, they decided to conjugate both competencies in to develop this project.

What Xpressomics does is takes this publicly available genetic data and indexes it. Much like Google we rank the data according to relevancy.

Financial information on SMEs is hard to get. Next to this, information is usually out-dated, biased and time consuming to analyse. This often creates a higher risk and makes it too expensive for an investor or financier to invest in those SME companies. Suppose someone is investing: getting information after the investment is done is even more time consuming as it has to be done on a regular base. This makes it difficult for SMEs to convince investors and financiers. The solution we offer is to provide all the stakeholders (entrepreneur, bank, investor, advisor, accountant) with up-to?date and automated information on the SME. This decreases workload and lowers the risk for banks and investors which makes it easier to invest or finance SMEs. After the investment is done, information will be also provided in a fully automated way. We extract information from services that are already use by entrepreneurs, so no extra hassle. Think about accounting packages (+600 accountancy packages) and other web services used by the company, so it is probably best to describe us a ?Geckoboard for investors and financiers?. Sparkholder has developed several analytical algorithms as well as several banking models (rating model and default model). In two cases with big Dutch banks we predicted a default of one of their clients months before their own systems did. With the Finodex project we want to enrich the company specific data with free available ?open data?, so we can regress the available information and make comparisons.

One of them, focused on raise private equity has been growing during the last years, both on private funds and Internet alternatives (crowd funding platforms, list of business angels like angel.list and others). This part is being improved year?by?year and becoming much more popular. Access to other alternative funding like public funding hasn?t improved in any way. Although the information related to such funding public programmes is Open Data, and published to be available for every company/person, it is not structured in any way; the requirements and conditions to participate are continuously changing so the several financial schemes existing in Europe are quite difficult to be understood and followed by the majority of the companies -because are highly time and personnel recourses consuming?. In this sense many companies should contact experts to advise them on how to participate. There is not any initiative/advances to aggregate all the public information about public funding in Europe, just small companies showing a small spectrum of the European public funding scope.

A key part of any project and especially an R&D project, either externally sponsored or internally supported, is its accurate financing given the higher risks associated with R&D. Such projects are mostly initiated, developed and implemented by subject experts who are not necessarily experts on budgets and financial analysis. This invariably results in financial discrepancies in projects having similar scope, quality and time. The lack of time and long-winded processes/systems for financial management are major concerns (though of little interest) to most subject experts. The result is that subject experts are not in control of their budgets, which are handled mostly by administrators with lack of project specific research awareness. Many challenges remain in automating and learning about budgets from analysing successful projects. Our web app (called MyBudget) will help users to prepare budgets with no prior knowledge of budgeting rules or financial management in a simple yet intelligent way.

Selling or exporting incorrectly treated products leads to product image damage, restrictions to sale and severe fines due to the health risk caused. In order to offer a solution to this problem, this project will provide a useful system for helping agricultural companies and individual farmers in the task of choosing the most suitable pesticide for their crops avoiding potential risks to human health and environment.

Although monitoring is already widely used in high voltage (HV) transmission grids, there is presently very limited monitoring of low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) distribution systems because of their huge extent which makes the cost of applying conventional HV monitoring techniques prohibitive. Our monitoring solution would allow the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to detect violations of system operating limits in real?time and, therefore, to plan and operate their systems much more safely and effectively and to integrate higher volumes of distributed energy resources (DERs) at the distribution level. Gridhound?s novel approach to grid monitoring is based on the concept of using data that is not directly associated with the grid topology. The question of data protection does not arise as the data used is abstract and its physical relation to the grid is known only to the DSO. Gridhound can perform grid voltage estimation with very few measurements, but with increasing accuracy as more measurements become available. This allows it to be gradually adopted by a DSO: as the DSO gains confidence in the product, they can provide more input measurement data and get an improved grid estimation. The project will develop a product called Grid Monitoring Unit (GMU) as a cloud?based application, based on FIWARE GEs and DSEs and using open weather and geographical data.",Tech provider,,X,0,0,0,X,0,Hardware,Hardware based solution,#N/A,#N/A,1,X,0,Group of Entrepreneurs,10000,gridhound.de

At the heart of the Platform is the Open Hardware-based Smart Health Patch, a sticker with sensors that attaches to the chest and communicates using Bluetooth LE with Bluetooth-enabled gateways such as the user's smartphone. The roject combines vital signs data from the sensors with PhysioNet Open Data for algorithmic combination, comparison and analysis of vital signs for both healthy persons as persons with specific medical conditions. The Platform publishes new Open Data in its own right and allows for third-party add-ons for Data Analysis and vital signs algorithm development. Use cases of this generic Open Platform with continuous monitoring and real-time response are found in: medical care (non-ICU clinical patients), chronic disease monitoring, sleep monitoring, elderly care, small children's care and scientific research. The developed technology is different from existing alternatives in that it: (1) maximizes social impact allowing free use, modification and production, (2) puts the user in full control of his data and privacy, (3) allows for open and independent safety, security and privacy reviews, (3) minimizes ecological impact and optimizes human conditions in the supply chain by applying 'fair technology' design thinking and (4) will go through certification for medical use and allows for easy application in clinical trials and research.",Tech provider,,0,0,X,X,X,0,Hardware,Hardware based solution,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,Group of Entrepreneurs,0,wemaketotem.org

 To fulfill this vision, SensoWave is going to develop an eHealth service platform that monitors the condition of these patients based on the information extracted from different sensors deployed in the patient?s home; sensors available in smartphones and even other wearables like smart bands. 
 Data from home sensors, wearables, and smartphone apps are continuously collected and monitored, and alerts are instantly sent to family members and caregivers if any events or irregularities occur. The platform informs about the location and current condition of the patient, using OpenData and using FIWARE GEs, and customizes an emergency protocol to minimize the damage. To improve their care, the algorithm learns from patient behaviour and it will be adapted that behaviour. The algorithm is self-adapting to the condition of each patient.
 Our platform will offer flexible solutions that connect patients to their care teams, providing healthcare professionals critical patient data, and enabling them to provide customized care in an easy, affordable way.
 Furthermore our platform will offer a social network to help patients, families, and health professionals by exchanging their experiences and sharing advices.

For these reasons, the development of dynamic noise maps, which frequently vary and allow monitoring of annoying events, as well as the design of gas emissions frameworks are a necessity that must contribute to the effectiveness of municipal action plans.
 In this context, the product we present, an App able to offer this information in an attractive and intuitive way, plays a central role.

Using the Knicy backend, developers are able to create new campaigns, meaning this that they can produce new routes in the city, adding checkpoints on it where part of the story is told to the users by a virtual guide and giving them also trophies if they overcome the challenges. These trophies go from a diploma showing that your team won the campaign to free drinks and food in the pub nearby, souvenirs, tickets to museums or shows?
In the final users? case, the application allows to choose the city you want to visit, showing two options: ?Visit the city in two days? and ?Campaigns?. The first choice lets the users discover the most important places in the city following its most important routes allowing them to learn those places? history, the events that took place there and the legends surrounding them. There will be free routes so that these users can test the application and, if they like it buy other routes in the city.

They work based on fixed schedules, not being aware of waste container status. This makes waste storage facilities and containers at the cities vulnerable, having security issues due to some hazardous materials that should remain as less time as possible at these facilities.

Every year, farmers come across the same question: ?which new cultivations thrive and have optimal yields in my fields?? or ?where can I find optimal growing conditions for a new profitable cultivation??. The latter question also stands for investors in Agrifood.
OCGC application addresses these questions offering to its users the yields (meaning crop productivity) of 100+ modern cultivations for every area of Europe. It estimates dynamically the yields taking under consideration on-line soil and climatic data along with the terrain model (physicochemical data), thus assisting users to choose the most suited and sustainable cultivations for their needs. The app also offers, for 100+ cultivations: a) eligibility for direct payments by the Common Agricultural Policy and b) detailed cultivation instructions and field work dairy as well as Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions required by the CAP (Reg. (EC) 73/2009).
OCGC offers one more function: the user can feed more detailed data (see above) for his field and get back the most suited crops for him. 
The app is user-friendly and functions in desktops or mobile phones. OCGC acquires the coordinates from the embedded GPS or the users can simply define the area of his interest in the app?s map.

Demographic change is posing Europe important challenges. Ageing populations mean that there are more and more people in need of care and assistance, while the number of persons willing or able to deliver such care within the family is stagnating and dropping. Nursing homes and official care services are already unable to meet this growing need, given that most elderly people in need of care prefer to remain in their own home. It is for this reason (and also because care homes are expensive) that the number of people with relatives in need of care is increasing, often resulting in a clash between professional, family-related and care commitments. The market offers day-to-day assistance (as a complement rather than a replacement), designed to afford elderly people assistance in their day-to-day lives and/or provide relief for their relatives. However, if the need for such day-to-day assistance is unexpected or urgent, it is hard to find, as the market focuses mainly on the engaging of carers for long-term placements. A person in need of help currently needs to spend a long time searching through various competing websites in order to find a care assistant.
firstCarity uses digital FIWARE technology to provide a smart, scalable, future-proof solution to this problem:
- firstCarity is an internet platform combined with mobile applications that senior citizens or their family- members can use to obtain fast and easy access to day-to-day assistance from local sources.
- firstCarity does not provide mere care staff, but rather dedicated, professional and private assistants trained to work in a home environment.
- as a one-stop meta-platform, firstCarity offers fast and easy access to all help offers in a region, which are available within the shortest time frame at one glance.
- firstCarity will be designed from the outset as a multilingual, supra-regional and scalable initiative.

What would be a disastrous future scenario to avoid ? How will these scenarios evolve through time when more and more complex data becomes accessible? How can a city be constantly made aware of developments in science or society or technology breakthroughs so that competitive advantages can be taken adjusting city development planning, securing and increase prosperity ?

Being a Smart City entails more than optimizing the flow of data within a city, it also requires a city to foresee & shape development itself in the most intelligent manner possible.

4Sight4Cities will enable metropolitan mayors, city planners and other stakeholders to become aware of the future through scanning new occurrences of data/information that potentially will impact the development of a city. These occurrences, or FUTURE-SIGNALS, can be surfaced and evaluated to identify potential city opportunities and warnings. Collaborative features aim at the integration of subject matter experts and citizens.

Our Datamantics algorithms will assist with the handling and growing complexity of relevant information from structured quantitative sources and semantic unstructured sources, separating ""noise"" from ""signal. They help to crunch, log, analyze, extrapolate and connect data, which than can be used to simulate and match diversified chain-of-events-scenarios.

These pictures of the future embrace uncertainty and help to navigate through the known and unknown dangers and advantages of a wider range of paths, to shape common objectives, guiding principals and values for the SMART CITY of tomorrow!

The app is easily downloadable from the App store. There is no registration: all you need is to subscribe to the car-sharing services. Once you enter the Bat Sharing app, it will automatically show your position and the closest cars. You can plug in your departure and Bat Sharing will present you with various options based on your current location, allowing you to compare them by duration and price, all in real-time.

This will not only reduce the traffic jams in crowded cities but also reduce the environmental pollution by exhaust gases.
Concrete factories typically subcontract most of their logistics processes to transport providers that own truck mixers and concrete pumps. The coordination is very challenging since concrete delivery is very time critical and is influenced by many factors such as the weather and delays on construction. Currently dispatchers at the concrete factories spend stressful hours on their phones each day just calling for the right driver and still often the optimum allocation between factory and truck is not found due to lack of information.
We will create a market platform that allows concrete factories and transportation companies to request and allocate vehicles in a much easier way and hereby exploit the huge potential for cost savings and increase in turnover of both parties. Dispatchers will be able to enter their vehicle requests into the platform, distribute them automatically to a set of relevant transportation companies and receive a confirmation from the winning contractor. The contractor in turn can use the platform to allocate jobs to his vehicles and hereby gain transparency about their load capacity. He will also immediately identify his inactive vehicles.

Every single year, about US$ 150.000.000 (150 million) waste worth is thrown into landfills. However, waste is only valuable if separated, and most of it is not. For a more concrete idea, in Brazil, only 1% of all waste produced is recycled. Thus, we went to the streets, and discovered why it is not being effective. After several analysis from the major countries in the world, we discovered several reasons that make waste separation unsuccessful, and which most impressed us is that it is definitely not fun. So, why not make all of this fun and exciting? Through Binee, people will have a fully experience about the trash lifecycle as well as have fun with the gamification form of waste separation.
We split the value created among three major parts: the recycling companies, users, and us. Each Binee breaks even in three months after its installation. The more Binee trash cans we install, the more value we create.

Most of these networks were launched with public funding and the support of local politicians. It can be concluded that once the funding expires most networks do not have the financial capabilities to survive. Sadly, many only live and provide very limited services for their members. As the operator of one network with more than 100 IT companies in the metropolitan region of Hannover, we have been thinking about other options to facilitate the long term success for these networks.
With this concept we are aiming to provide an IT platform based on FIWARE which provides three core elements: A market place function, a calendar of events and a campus for education and training. Preassembled bundles of FIWARE provide a solid good foundation for our planned services and activities.
Many networks are stuck by discussions around the various interests of its members and limit the options for expansion in the region where they have been established. With the help of a marketplace containing the products and services from all members, transparency is delivered for the network members and potential clients. This will increase the marketing power and value-add of the network directly to the region. The bundled marketing from a central platform will support many small companies. The offered services on the operator side of the platform provide a specific value which can be used by active networking. As a result science and industry and SMEs have the opportunity for e.g. training on site.
We will start with the implementation of the IT platform for our own network as a pilot installation and want to enhance the IT platform with additional services. Furthermore we aim to offer the platform for other networks after the successful pilot phase. In this case, the network itself may not be the customer, but it may be, that an economic development department of a city or region buys or rents the platform.

The proposed service aims to face and solve needs of farmers and agro-food SMEs such as the visibility in the market, the interoperability with customers and the introduction of state-of-art business and technology topics into their production. The proposed apps will be provided to a large number of agro-food SMEs through the web, in order to enhance their market competitiveness. In addition, the proposed project aims to facilitate the update of Web2.0 technologies in order for them to deploy services to their SME members that can support them in their everyday businesses. Examples include map-based location services for the farmers in some region. 
The main results of the BuyFromFarm project will be two apps:
ƒ??	Apps for farmers and local agri food SMEs allowing to offer their products on the web and advertisement, but also manager ordering, invoicing and CRM.
ƒ??	Apps for customer, with primary focus on search for certain products in certain location based on location based services, but also make orders, provide navigation to the farm and also supporting social tagging and bookmarking.
On the server side, there will be application supporting spatial queries (OpenStreetMap will be used as base map), CRM, but also ontology or vocabulary allowing to translate orders among different languages. There will be also used advanced visualisation methods like virtual reality or 3D visualisation to attract potential customers.

The digitalisation of moving image productions and their distribution has produced a whole range of new media services in recent years that - with Youtube at the fore - have led to a veritable boom in video content. Above all, a new generation of filmmakers is using the possibilities of modern technology to their own benefit: many vloggers and young production companies, as well as cultural initiatives, local NGOs and companies produce large quantities of high-quality video material about events in their cities or relating to news from specific content areas on a daily basis. Material that could be very interesting for professional users such as media online portals, TV stations or publishers. However, the exchange between new and established video producers remains difficult, as the possibilities for targeted searching for regional or specialised content on conventional video platforms is severely limited. Moreover, the very open nature of the content often results in large uncertainties in relation to copyright and licensing rights. A professional, systematic exchange between suppliers and consumers, therefore, is not possible. We want to enable this exchange with our project. It will act as a digital exchange for local and specialist video productions, on which producers can actively market their content. Users are offered a clearer, more professional and legally secure service that will help to raise awareness of new, young and regional suppliers.

FIWARE technologies such as Object Storage, Key Management and 2DUI provide the perfect framework for data handling along all stages of design and production.
Our aim is the development of a full production line, from the first user input, visualization, processing of custom shapes, storing on distributed (cloud) services, to online-purchases, easy payment, automatic order processing, 3D printing, mold optimization if required, material casting and finally shipping of the 3D printed product to the customers. Social integration by making-and-sharing should be implemented to provide a unique fun driven user experience.
Optimizing the production process, material research, reducing production costs and different 3D printing methods for different product requirements is the long-term task. ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

Situation: Huge structural elements on-site need continuous reporting. Every detail, like a welding seam or a bore hole, has to be released from an authorised person. Without release no structural element can be licenced to operate. The reporting has to clearly identify each part  and has to fulfil high legal requirements. The inspection of huge structural elements on-site generates an unmanageable amount of reports (e.g. e-mails, photos, markings, documents, revision instructions, approvals). The organisation, handling and researching of reports is time-consuming, expensive and error-prone.
Approach: The DocPointer allocates reports generated on-site automatically in a secure database and provides a legally sound documentation history for auditing. The docPointer reduces the time of production, particularly the final acceptance of construction work. The management and retrieval of information (non conformed reports NCR) becomes efficient and exact. 
Objectives: The ƒ??pointer"" identifies all relevant documentation of an object by using GPS coordinates, photo material, engineering drawing or a 3D-model. Additional personal data (Name, Date, Time, Authorization, Permission) is recorded. The generation of the pointer is based on Fi-Ware.
Example: The application spectrum of the DocPointer is manifold (e.g. bridge construction, ship building, high-rise building). In this project the DocPointer should use the example of offshore windfarm grounding. The erecting of Windpower stations fundaments (Tripods) requires very high legal efforts (comparable to marine technique). One fundament needs 600 welding seams for example. 80 windmills in a plant are leading to 48.000 (!) welding seams which have to be identified individually. Reducing the production time of one wind turbine results cost saving of ~ 200.000 ƒ?ª/day! This is why the DocPointer is a very useful tool to keep the construction plant smart and safe.

It is expensive (high license and support fees), hard to maintain (due to fat client solutions) and offers almost no interaction with a largely young customer base that is used to mobile devices.

The lack of mobile interaction poses a major drawback within current driving school software, since ƒ??sharingƒ?, ƒ??tweetingƒ? or ƒ??likingƒ? have become very common.

drive.guru offers driving schools and learner drivers a modern software ecosystem in order to communicate with each other in realtime via mobile devices, webapp and social media. To create a seamless experience between driving schools and their students, drive.guru takes a lightweight approach through a web application and a mobile app. This means true portability, easy maintainability, social interaction and continuous innovation in a sector with almost no digital mobile driven processes.

The three major cornerstones are: (1) A scheduling module, which lets you schedule, cancel and reschedule appointments (2) a digital billboard offering miscellaneous realtime information and last but not least (3) a referral module designed for learner drivers to win fellow learner drivers via social media.

All of this is developed with - and backed by scalable FIWARE technology. This ecosystem boosts our productivity since it offers many production ready components, which save us precious development time and guarantee a solid and scalable foundation to our services.

The idea was developed by the team during our Masters in Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). We came up with a solution for minimizing unnecessarily doctor visits. By providing a platform for online doctor consultation we eliminate the time and energy consuming transit of the patient from home to the doctors office. At the same time, by integrating a hardware home device that measures the basic health parameters (like temperature and blood pressure), we shorten the time of the consultation: the doctor receives information about these parameters via the platform, and does not need to make the measurements him or herself. These online consultations will be designed as a preliminary step in the treatment mainly in order to assess, whether it is necessary for the patient to physically come to the doctorƒ??s office.
In order to make our product work we will use the following FI-WARE technologies: Orion Context Broker, Orion PEP proxy, Cygnus, Cosmos, Wirecloud, Security Monitoring, and Kurento.
Our team consist of members from the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Austria and met during our Master in Entrepreneurship & Innovation where we decided to take our idea to the next level. We have work experience in different industries such as hospitality, event management, and healthcare. Our academic background ranges from marketing, communications, and international development, to entrepreneurial economics and hospitality management. We have experienced a great complementarity among us while working together and believe that we are able to execute the idea behind EasyDoc successfully.

For end customers the service allows to reduce bills for electricity up to 30%. For energy retailers Ecoisme helps to reduce power peaks and offer energy retailersƒ?? customers a value added service.

The service provides easy, low-cost and effective solution for monitoring and saving energy at customersƒ?? homes. All they need to do is to attach Ecoisme sensor to their main power line and connect it to Ecoisme cloud. The sensor measures total energy consumption and sends data to Ecoisme cloud-based system. Then the system singles out every device, plugged-it to the electrical grid to show how efficient they are. Based on this information, Ecoisme will recommend customers easy-to-follow advices to save energy. Moreover, for customers with smart meters the company will offer limited functionality of the service even without installing any additional hardware.

To identify home appliances, Ecoisme uses a comprehensive technology, which combines power and spectral analysis. Therefore with the help of a single low-cost hardware device at customersƒ?? homes, Ecoisme allows them to identify all home appliances and all electrical devices even with power consumption that varies.

Energy saving is not only benefit of Ecoisme. Since it can identify every single device in the home, Ecoisme will know if customers forgot to switch off an iron or other home appliances and advise them to do so.

The project is in a closed beta-testing stage now. We raised seed investments from Deutsche Telekom and incorporated in Poland.

This will reduce the farmers overall cost to achieve the same yield, while giving the customer more time to focus on the important tasks required to keep the customers farm running.
The innovative feature of this software is that it requires no manual work to retrieve data, using drones to collect the same data is time consuming and expensive, FieldSense uses readily available satellite data, in a innovative easy-to-use platform, that allows any farmer to easily see and understand data about his fields and crops.

You could not bother or already failed? We give people the opportunity to grow their own food, even if they have limited time, space or experience, as it is often the case in urban areas. Although urbanization has caused many people to live without direct contact to agriculture, many citizens (e.g., LOHAS) set high value in healthy food, and they are aware of the importance of sustainable and organic cultivation. The Family Farming application approaches this task by a combination of a smart raised-bed gardening box, called the Agrarium, with a wireless web and mobile application that guides the user to a successful harvest. Thanks to the FIWARE Generic and Specific Enabler (GE/SE) software libraries, we are able to efficiently and easily implement complex Internet of Things (IoT) intercommunication. The successful real world farming experience depends critically on FIWARE which provides a sophisticated framework for various tasks, including data exchange and analysis, user interface design, social networking and access control. Sensors within the Agrarium provide data about temperature, humidity, luminosity and nutritional value which the customers can use and which will be evaluated and illustrated by selected FIWARE software solutions. The web and mobile applications provide the user with appropriate guidance and instructions based on context data evaluated by the FIWARE network. Since FIWARE Enablers went open source, we are able to contribute to the developing community. We will help to drive FIWARE forward into the future while benefitting from a network of experienced programmers, hence reducing production cost and time. Our project guarantees a successful farming experience to people who wish to produce their own food and the FIWARE Enablers help to re-establish an awareness not only for the importance of sustainable food but also for the complex challenge of urban agriculture.

It will be easy and safe to use, with no need to install plugins or software from either the citizen or the public official in the agency, thanks to the Fiware Kurento Video Server. We increase accessibility for government services for all citizens (especially disabled individuals and older adults), by integrating local government agencies and public officials into a map using the Fiware POI Data Provider. Citizens can search and connect to the right person for the right question, either from home or from mobile devices. This will reduce the time to find the appropriate public official for specific questions and will decrease the amount of traffic within cities. 

Deaf people for example will be able to connect to any public official and request a sign language translator to join the video conference. This facilitates inclusion and empowers deaf and otherwise disabled people, whoƒ??re still confronted with barriers when using public services in their daily life. We can enable government agencies, and other organizations as well, to easily comply with current laws that require maximum accessibility and inclusion of disabled individuals. Older adults, who often exhibit great limitations to their mobility, can connect and talk to public officials from the safety of their own home. The platform can be used in other public and private sectors as well. For instance, political parties can become more visible and accessible to the general population by integrating into the open street map and allow to connect via video conference calls on just one platform. Other options of use could be in education, travel agencies, business consulting and finances.

I live with my family on a large farm, we have 350 milk cows milking in milkrobots. I have always been interested in technology and specially how we can use it in our day of work. When I was 17 years old I founded my startup VicVision. Today we are working mainly with mobile apps in agriculture. Today I have a mobile app called ""G??rdskoll"" (farmcontrol in Swedish), I have around 100 farms (customers) and we are growing day by day. We saw a need on our farm to have better control of our fuel consumtion. We have around 15 tractors and fuel it's a big cost for us. Before my app we manually with pen and paper keep track of our fuel consumption but it all ended up with stacks of papers and nobody wanted to transform the papers into the computer. We saw a need there and I've solved it with my app. Nowadays we just open my app ""G??rdskoll"", while waiting for the pump to fuel up we just enter some info about which tractor, which driver, what task we were doing and so on. Everything is stored in the cloud and we can access our data anytime anywhere. The app automatic calculates our cost and we can see exactly what every task costs in terms of fuel cost. With all that data we can make better decisions to improve our machinery. We can save both time and resources with my app. This is a great idea and on the European market I'am nearly unique with this. In a world when climate changes is on the top of the news and when we need to save our future this is a great step! My idea is to implement some FIWARE technology in my existing app. It could be things like IoT-sensors. I have today many ideas of how I can improve my solution with FIWARE technology. For example I would like to see some temperatures in my milk tank and FIWARE will get the data, map it up with diagrams and charts so I can be alerted when something might happened.

But there are much more interesting spots which are not evaluated yet whether they could be of interest for a day trip, e.g., museums, caf??s, events, etc.
GeoInfo4Kids displays the wide range of information on a map view to see what can be reached easily or is located in a certain area. It assists you in combining multiple targets that are close to each. While completing the list of errands it helps you to find a good spot for the children nearby and allows them to have a break at a nice place. GeoInfo4Kids will collect data from different sources and provide a set of side details like weather, public transport, user ratings etc. It prevents you from the need of checking a set of web pages and gives you all information on a single page instead. The system enables the users to add events and places. Furthermore, the users can write comments, add photos, videos, or more detailed descriptions. This will help to keep the system alive!
GeoInfo4Kids can be accessed via web page or alternatively as an app on a mobile device. Localisation can be used by the app users and the software will show you how to find the Point of Interest. The user group can be easily classified which makes the software attractive for advertisement partners.

Usually, the bigger programs are multi partner programs, meaning consumers collect points at different stores and get something useless (bags, water kettle etc.) in return. The truth is that all of these card companies are simply keen on personal data. It is very attractive to combine consumer data with their behaviour and preferences and sell this enriched personal data afterwards to shops for marketing reasons. 
Approximately 24 month ago a team of five people thought, the time has come to realise the ƒ??most honest customer cardƒ? in the world. The card/app should be useable anonymously (no data misuse possible) and customers using the card should be given a real reward at the shop where they collected points. Furthermore should it be possible to support local charity organisation by donating points. Why not entitling someone in need to pick up some fresh vegetables at a local supermarket by simply donating some points? Last but not least, a fair customer card should of course send newsletters and coupons, but please just send people stuff they really need and like. In total, we think treating people fairly will result in a good return rate of the card, which is than good for shops. So far, we are proud to having realised a first prototype and also sold some license of our system. Approx. 70% of the distributed cards (6.000) are used on a daily basis. We call that a good start for a loyalty system.
However, it does not mean that our system cannot be extended. Although the entire system is designed for stationary shops, we solely use internet and web technologies. This is a perfect match to integrate FIWARE components to make our vision of the most honest loyalty card in the world even more realistic.

In an attempt to nudge the user towards saving energy, progress towards preset energy saving goals is presented to the user every time he or she looks at the clock. Also, GPS is used to coordinate access to the energy consumption data.

The design is meant for larger organizations or facilities. This is because a large number of consumers inevitably lead to large energy consumption, thus, the design will have a larger impact here. Furthermore, this setup makes it manageable to reach a vast amount of people since they all travel around the same facilities.

The thesis is that a visualization of the energy consumption will lead a reduction of it. In this case it is mentionable that the thesis has been tested in previous projects of WizArts. To read more about this look at our Techem case. Thus, it is not a question about the viability of visualization in regards to a more energy-conscious behavior; it is a question about how the visualization will be manifested. In this regard WizArts is working on various methods, both virtual and physical.
To induce a more energy-conscious behavior WizArts will implement gamification in the final solution. This is done in order to make dull tasks as walking the stairs, shutting of the power, and etc. fun to do.

Furthermore, WizArts aims to encourage a general positive change in behavior of the users. WizArts solution does not limit itself to reduction of energy-consumption. We see the bigger picture. People are more likely to change their behavior if other people are doing the same. This is why we will implement social elements in our final solution. To live cleaner and healthier is something we do together for each other.

For employees it offers a possibility to get to know their mobility profile and to learn how they can decrease their CO2-output. Next to that the app makes employees work together towards a common goal, which increases work floor engagement.
For employers it is a chance to decrease mobility budgets and CO2-emissions. This makes it so that employers can use these efforts in their communication and show the outside world that they are working on becoming a ƒ??green companyƒ??.
For employers it is also a tool to create behavioural change in their company. Although all effects in the application are short term, because of the duration of participation and the use of gaming design principles a long lasting behavioural change is a noticeable effect.

Moreover Arabic speaking refugees will support us with the collection of voice and handwritten samples in Arabic in order to improve the performance of an audio and visual recognition system that will permit to include in the future, a functionality for voice and hand written requests for the mobile application. One of the key factors of such a machine learning system is the quantity and quality of data used. Since the available data for Arabic is currently very limited and costly to acquire, we will combine this technical constraint with the currently urgent need of the refugees in Germanyto have an occupation and a means to be integrated in the German society
Refugees will participate actively on the definition and development of the system. In this way their current condition of not having a work permit is taken as the advantage of having the time to actively participate in the project.

The balance of these factors determine agricultural production and the livelihood of millions of people. 
The agricultural production cycle is long-drawn, intervention possibilities are limited and must be initiated with the outmost care as they can ignite complex biological reactions and adverse effects. If the land is disturbed beyond a certain point the negative effects can be non-reversible or can only be corrected to a limited extent.
Insect traps are used for monitoring and reducing pest population. In most cases traps are based on pheromones or on sticky substances placed on a coloured surface; the ƒ?§bateƒ?? is chosen according to the type of the pest: fly, roach, moths, etc. In order to act in the shortest possible time and to reduce monitoring costs, an integrated solution with camera, GPRS controller, solar panel and backup power supply will be developed and put in place with the aim of significantly improving the usage of insect traps. The pictures taken by the camera will be transmitted by the GPRS controller to a computer which has a specific software installed for insect monitoring. The algorithm will be based on registering the changes in the number of insects in the trap. The changes/results will be sent to a computer for monitoring which will enable the user to act in accordance to the pre-defined action plan. The algorithm is pest type independent and can be used for indoor and outdoor applications. FIWARE and cloud-use will make the application Future Internet compatible.

Consequentially, this will not only increase the job or business opportunities, especially in IT, in Germanybut also avoid brain drain. Germany, as many other countries, are missing talented web entrepreneurs and coders with skills. Further, the students, invited to study in the local universities, are lacking of business opportunities and internships. We will also provide training in the domain of FIWARE technologies that will help us to create resource pool of students and thus can provide companies lacking such experts. 
Along with supporting local industries with talented IT employee, we will specialize in developing dynamic, sophisticated and user-friendly web sites. The demand and growth rate for these services in the small and medium business market is at its peak and shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.
Very few web development companies have taken advantage of this opportunity, as there are no dominating participants in this huge market. Most importantly, experienced and skilled immigrants, students and freelancers can provide innovative solutions for all these services.

Information and communications technologies (ICT) are shaping urban development. An entire urban area can be equipped with sensors that make all their captured data available in the cloud. The result is a constant interaction between the city dwellers and the technology that surrounds them.
Our concept is to enable the inhabitants of a city to participate in its maintenance. With the help of an intelligent framework solution (mobile app), it is possible to easily and quickly document all types of problems or damage in public spaces, and forward that information to the appropriate authorities. The app automatically determines the exact location (geodata) and any additional data added by the person reporting the incident. Photos, videos, audio recordings, or text can be included in the documentation and used to help the appropriate agencies quickly identify a potentially unsafe situation. They can then send construction companies directly to the site to repair the damage. The citizens themselves are part of the technical infrastructure of their city.

We will help them to win assistance and support for their projects with the help of our time donation app that enables the inhabitants of smart cities to donate time for actions and projects. Our app will match their profiles and the distance to the point where support is needed for beach cleanings, campaigns, dives, flashmobs, repair actions etc.. Activists can accept such invitations and see on a map where they should go and what they are expected to do. 
The German Ocean Foundation will also take the role of a communication hub and as a representative communicating with governments.

As we target a broad audience not accustomed to automation technology, the utilization shall be as simple as possible. Therefore we build upon well known techniques from social media platforms to establish the connection between the device, the user and the renewable energy plant supplying the power needed.
In contrast to social media based energy saving contests, which engage the user socially but do not interact with the power flow directly, the smart plug hardware contains sensors and a relay. Thus, fully automatic physical demand response can be accomplished, without the requirement of user interactions during runtime.
For doing so, the website of the Open Energy Exchange (OEEX) shows details of nearby generators and their operators in a facebook-style profile on a map, from which users select the preferred target.
As a bottom-up demand response innovation, we suggest to transfer the intuitive concept of ƒ??followingƒ?? from social networks to smart grids: a power generator publishes its energy generation measurements and consumers can choose a target to follow with their flexible loads, e.g. an electric vehicle can follow the ownerƒ??s or neighbourƒ??s solar panel or wind generator. The flexible loads then aim to balance some of the fluctuation in generation, thus increasing the tolerable penetration limits of fluctuating energy sources.
In contrast to Renewable Energy Certificates, which provide market segmentation and price discrimination but are prone to ƒ??greenwashingƒ??, the ƒ??followingƒ?? concept aligns the real power flows in the network, while giving the customer the chance to build up a personal relation to his preferred energy source and thus the energy consumed.

The first step is to have a proper diagnostic preferably at an early stage. Pest and disease diagnostics are sought by farmers either by talking with each others, by calling a specialist or by sending plant samples to certified laboratories for analysis. Respectively, these ways seem to be ineffective, not be readily available (or not available at all) or take longer than needed.
OpenPD, an on-the-field and on-the-fly system for fast identification of plant pests and diseases, aims to provide a way to shorten the response time for a correct diagnostic of plant and crop pests and diseases by speeding up the process of identification. Supported by a database and a mobile app, users submit a digital photo of the affected plant part along with other relevant data and receive an answer leading to the diagnosis, coming from other users (general or specialists) or automatically by image interpretation and/or by a learning algorithm taking previous (positive) users answers. OpenPD will be reactive (usersƒ?? questions and answers) but also proactive (sending warnings and alerts to users) and will be structured as an open community model. Answers should be evaluated and users rewarded and ranked using a ranking pyramid model (evaluation by the users but also by the system). OpenPD will make use of at least 6 generic enablers from the FIWARE Catalogue and be integrated in FISpace. OpenPDƒ??s business model customer acquisition component will by supported by its Freemium model, strategic partnerships with public and private organizations, media partnerships and digital media plan.

Many of such services are based on various types of monitoring activities, like monitoring the vital parameters (e.g. measuring blood pressure regularly), monitoring the physical activity of caretakers (e.g. not to lay in the bed too long), monitoring the environmental condition (e.g. not to walk too long on a hot day), whereas most of them can be performed remotely. We argue that smart cities, as places where an enormous majority of caretakers live, have to provide a solid infrastructure for the realization of such caregiving services, especially through the provision of different types of information which are relevant for caretakers and their health status (e.g. microclimate condition, level of air-pollution, noise-level, etc.).
In this proposal we propose a mobile solution which will reuse the smart city information infrastructure for the provisioning of monitoring-based caregiving services based on a novel technology for hybrid complex event processing, partially implemented using FIWARE technology, which enables continuous personalized and proactive monitoring of caretakers, including alarming caregivers and families before some critical situation might happen.

Nowadays, in the night-time cities are constantly illuminated by street lighting; from dusk till dawn, public and private lights enlighten streets, public gardens, parking, industries, etc. despite people actually spend time there. This results in a huge waste of energy due to the fact that during the night most of the time outdoor public and private places have very low frequency of human activities. This is especially true in suburban areas located at the edge of cities and in the country side where most of the social activities happens during the day.
The goal of the project is to support a novel smart real-time lighting product, enlightening locations only if actually required. To this purpose, our product will recognize basic human activities, e.g., people walking, bike riding, and car driving, to dynamically change street lighting on/off status and intensity to fulfil the light needs. For instance, people crossing a street may require intense localized lighting to allow approaching cars to spot people in advance while bike riders could benefit from intense lighting where they currently are and soft lighting along the street in the direction of bikes.
The project will adopt low cost arrays of infrared camera to monitor target areas and detect any motion: whenever an infrared camera perceives a movement, it notifies the cloud-based system in charge of applying pattern recognition algorithms to detected the type of movement. Whenever there is no movements (or detected movement is not interesting, e.g., foliage movements due to the wind) overall street illumination is reduced by either decreasing light intensity or switching off (part of) light spots.

The spatial underwater admissions from Central American Belize - so far unique in the world -   with 5 high-resolution cameras should provide together with the night sky in the planetarium an emotional framework to connect people emotionally with the Sea. Celebrated speakers - for example marine researcher Prof. Mojib Latif and climatologist Prof. Hartmut Grassl will present different areas of expertise regarding the ocean to provide through contents an inside into the different views of the ocean. An understanding will be created for the huge potential that the oceans have for humans and that we need to conserve. In a cooperation between the audience and the producers show elements will be developed and applied in the show for a maximal success. Through an interactive website, operated through FiWare, visitors and society have the opportunity to shape essential elements of the show and to participate interactively on a later point in time. For example, it is possible for the audience to search with the ƒ??Augmented Realityƒ?? tool for certain objects at the screen. Part of the 60 minute long presentation will be visible by the movement of mobile devices in the audience. On the website of the show additional information of the show can be seen: an interactive map will provide places and themes of the next show locations. To bring Europe closer together the shows will be streamed on the website with added English and Spanish subtitles to make the show available to a bigger and international audience. In the next step the show will also be implemented in other European cities.  ",0,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

1 .Data on food waste in all the links of the chain: from field to fork.
2. The decrease of Italian familiesƒ?? purchasing power due to economic recession.
3. Consumption reduction.
4. Consumerƒ??s growing interest in food traceability along the entire supply chain.

6. The solutions offered by Internet of Things, its evolution and ever growing diffusion.
7. The constant and widespread diffusion of smartphones and, more generally, mobile devices.
These premises suggested the adoption of a tool that takes advantage of technology and public awareness of social and environmental issues, thereby meeting the needs of the consumer, who wants to save money, the retailer, who wants to reduce costs, and the environment, which demands eco-sustainable solutions.

The jobs of many people rely on accurate and timely information about opinions ƒ?? among them product developers and business developers, journalists, researchers and politicians. Yet, there is no one place that provides the latest information about public opinion easily, valid and fast. The mission of sentibar is to close that gap. sentibar uses smart algorithms to collect information about opinions and attitudes from surveys and opinion polls. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a news aggregator that provides external links to survey results. Listening closely to user feedback we will gradually add features towards creating a proper data hub. The data hub offers users access to survey results and to complete data sets. Interactive visualization and reporting are further features that improve the user experience. The vision is that we enhance data quality, provide data access and therefore improve the opportunities for action of citizens.
But sentibar does not stop there. We are passionate about surveys and we want to reveal hidden information. Users provide us with their interests so that we can deliver tailored information products. We see who is interested in the same topics and we can use this information to connect people with the same interests, building powerful knowledge clusters for Smart Cities around opinion data. Eventually, an international survey data base enriched by user interaction data is a unique treasure trove of information. It allows us to identify patterns, build better and new products. And we can share this knowledge with research institutions who are in turn interesting partners for us.
This proposal lays the foundations for our larger endeavour. Some generic enablers are used for the MVP, while CKAN allows us to leapfrog and quickly reach the stage of a data hub.

By finding more suitable cargoes, the ships can increase their capacity utilization by reducing their idle time.
Presently much of communication is done by email in nearly standardized formats (often called circulars), giving details of a cargo-, the origin- and destination-, the time of shipment- and some other common terms. The short and relatively standardized format derives from times when the telex was the major technology used.
Business between cargo (Charterers) and ship (Ship Owners) is mostly done via intermediaries (Brokers) who will not simply share all their market information with the rest of the world.
We want to create a platform that allows users (Charterers, Ship Owners and Brokers) to allocate ships and cargo in a much easier way. At the same time users remain in full control about who they share their information with.
Employees at all three company types (Brokers, Charterers, Ship Owners) spend hours each day just scanning through these ƒ??circularsƒ?? and still often the optimum allocation between cargo and ship is not found due to lack of information. Ideally our platform can reduce work-load-, carbon emission produced by merchant ships and costs for raw materials for the end user.

In Germany, journalists speak about 1.6 million kids (aged under 15) living in poverty. Other European countries show similar numbers. The EU study in 2006 had shown a total of 19 million kids in Europe living under the poverty line. It seems essential for us ƒ?? especially in a highly developed nation and/or union ƒ?? to take over social responsibility for these circumstances in order to improve these figures. 

Thus, we thought about the possibility to establish an IT-based charity system allowing an intelligent contribution of used goods in good condition (donations in form of clothes, toys, furniture - not older than three years): ƒ??Recycle with Loveƒ? became our motto in order support kids and families in need.

Therefore, we developed the idea of a ƒ??modern, multifunctional charity platformƒ?

Smart Cities need Smart Kids. But in Germanyand other European countries, the public school system does not encourage and enable each kid to explore and develop all of their 21st century skills. When it gets to digital media literacy, basic coding skills and an understanding of computer sciences, most German schools lag behind; only weeks ago, the international ICILS 2013 study has made this very clear.

There is no lack of ideas. There is no lack of initiative. There is, obviously, a lack of willingness and knowledge on the side of those who decide on budgets, curricula, and the education of educators. And there's a lack of impact on the side of those ready to make a change. 

1.	Digital Media Literacy must become a part of the official curricula of public schools.

2.	Learning (and teaching) should be vastly improved, adding the richness of interactive digital media. 

Using FIWARE and starting in Hamburg, we will create SmartCityKids, an innovative technical platform to connect people, projects, products and places. This includes an inspiring knowledge-base with mobile outreach, accessible both in the physical and in the digital world. As a result, we will help to grow and support a strong community of kids, teachers and other stakeholders, ready to transform the classroom into a better place:

More fun. More engagement. More individual challenge and support. More productivity and learning success. More time for teachers to interact with their kids. In short: More 21st century skills.

Smart energy net is a platform for the training of employees in the renewable energy sector. 
Due to a shortage of skilled workers in the renewable energy sector, smart-energy-net offers a platform where workers/employees can train via an e-learning platform during outage- or waiting-times on mobile devices (e.g. smart-phones, tablets). Employers bear the training-costs, participating employees decide when and where they study and to which extend. When reaching a defined training-level, they can take an examination and archieve a certificate. This certification offers the possibility to obtain qualified jobs and improve earnings. 

At the same time, employers define education targets, improve the level of education among their staff and control their learning process. The learning-content is provided in different formats (e.g. interactive questionnaires, videos, 3-D Models). This way every participant can study according to own study preferences. Additionally, team work is strongly encouraged and the students develop a great deal of the material themselves (e.g. wikis, glossary, forums). 

This modern e-learning-philosophy corresponds to the trends of crowdsourcing and open innovation and in the process of studying participants compile their personal skill portfolio which is constantly improved.

These perspectives include ecologic, economic, geo-spatial, ethnographic, demographic, fiscal, business, health, technologic views on the transformation of cities into SmartCities. Connecting these perspectives by enabling to ask the right questions and make the informed decisions needs leadership. SmartCity Leadr enables leadership in the councils.

In our surroundings we recognized the difficulties parents sometimes have with their crying babies; which can be a point of frustration. So knowing what goes around in a babyƒ??s mind during one of his or her crying sessions, will allow us to optimally support the needs of the baby as well as the parent. 
While doing research about the aforementioned opportunity we saw that acoustic analysis of infant cry has been a focus of clinical and developmental research for a number of decades. A variety of approaches to cry analysis have been employed, but each has its drawbacks. However, Reggianni, et al (2013) developed a method to extract acoustic parameters describing infant cries from standard digital audio files with 88% to 95% accuracy. 

This brought us to the idea of the Smart Cuddle. SmartCuddle is a stuffed animal that helps parents to find out what their baby needs when it is crying. SmartCuddle has a high quality microphone inside and with this microphone the babyƒ??s crying is analyzed. After analyzing, devices in the environment of the baby, like an audio device or baby mobile, can be activated (through WiFi). The cry analyzer can send a signal to the mobile phone of the parent, telling them why their baby is crying. At the same time the cyring will be recorded automatically via the mobile application, so parents will learn recognizing the different types of crying form the baby and can adapt easier tot this in the future.

At the same time, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 40% by 2030 have to be met.
A recent study performed for the United Nations about the Development of Water Resources in the World estimates that climate change is responsible for 20% of the global increase in water scarcity, and the growth population and economic development responsible for the remaining 80%. 
We can see one of the most significant examples in the basins of the rivers in Niger, Lake Chad and Senegal, one of the largest basins in Africa, total available water has decreased from 40-60%.
This means that use the resources in the best possible way will make the difference between failure or success of our civilization.

With so high demand in food production and with an increasing limit on area available for food production, most of the 70% share in food production rise will be from technology. A global shift is in place right now in farming operations, from nearly no connected devices in 2000 to 2 billion of expected connected devices by 2035. 

We propose to develop a IoT platform focused in connecting sensors from several farming operations and local environmental sensors, integrating all these sensors in a common platform, uploading the data to a cloud database.

It will eliminate the transaction inefficiencies in the traditional trade process of Solar Power Purchase Agreements (SPPA) and Solar Leases (SL), enabling a win-win condition both for Solar Services Providers and for Rooftop Owners. 
SPPA and SL are contracts between a ƒ??Solar Services Providerƒ? who owns, utilizes, and maintains the photovoltaic project, and a ƒ??Rooftop Ownerƒ? who delivers a designated location for the solar installation such as an unutilized rooftop.  
In a SPPA, the Rooftop Owner agrees to purchase the energy output from the developer at a fixed price for a prearranged time period. In a Solar Lease, instead, the Rooftop Owner rents the solar equipment against a monthly remittance. In either cases, the Rooftop Owner is able to slash down his energy expenses drastically and notice long-term savings as current grid-electricity prices continue to increase. The Solar Services Provider pays for all the installation costs and is held responsible for the operation and maintenance of the project.
With SunnyRev, Rooftop Owners will be able to minimize the solar rate and maximize their savings by putting Producers in competition for their rooftops with a reverse auction mechanism. Bidding performed in real-time via the Internet will result in a dynamic, competitive process. This will help achieve rapid downward price pressure (energy price or lease remittance, depending of the case)  that is not normally attainable using traditional static paper-based bidding processes.

Citizens are getting older and live longer in their own homes. Among these elderly the ability to be physically active and have social interactions is an increasing problem. We propose an online platform where  older citizens can engage in a game that stimulates physical activity by interacting with their surroundings and neighbors. With an online platform participants are challenged to walk different routes to city waste containers based on their location of residence. While bringing out the trash, they leave virtual waste along these routes. Other participants, who are also actively involved in the game, can make increasingly challenging city walks to clean their local city map. Every week the duration of the city routes will be increased in order to promote a physically active lifestyle. The online platform brings older people together and enhances social interactions in the offline world for a WasteWalk in the city.

With that goal in mind we intend to develop an App for member of non-governmental organizations (NGO) and other third parties to collect and analyse Climate Change Observations in greater urban areas. Naturefriends International, with 500.000 members one of the bigger NGO and one of the ƒ??Green Tenƒ? largest environmental organisations and networks in Europe, will be our pilot user.
The resulting database consists of daily climate observations, then observations in reaction to extreme weather events and finally observations, which are scientifically relevant. Each observation will be marked in a Climate Change Reference Map. If requested, the user gets a feedback after every report she or he has sent using the application. This is the way we intend to build up a goldmine of climate related data. The group of observation reporters gain information about a subject, which is very helpful to reflect ancient meanings. Interpretations will differ more or less with the meanings of the ""experts"". But this will bring the ""amateurs"" and the ""experts"" together so that they can learn from each other within the meaning of a ""smart"" partnership.
As far as our market research has shown there are no competing solutions at the moment, which reach the requirements we are able to fulfil with the FIWARE technology. The open framework, independent with the ability to configure or customize, forms an outstanding basis for our approach. We intend to use Wirecloud GE as a powerful mashup platform and to integrate the required widgets like map viewer, photo viewer or climate observation reports. By means of FIWARE GE Context Broker we are able to mediate between the data producer and the data consumer. That makes it for example easy to update the observation status after changing.

The business idea is motivated by the drawback of traditional punch card, like ƒ??buy 10, get one freeƒ? programs for small businesses and their need to introduce more incentive for customer loyalty. Our approach postulates on the idea of customer loyalty through engaging with a business/merchant in a more sustainable way than only with reward points for each purchase. It means that an engaged customer should be motivated to identify with the business in different, daily life, situations she/he is involved in. Consequently, the customer should be rewarded for all such activities, usually through some kind of discount coupons or reward points. This leads to smart cities which provide infrastructure for developing smart business environment which on the other side engages citizens more in the city life.   
In order to achieve such an engagement we propose a mobile solution consisting of a) mobile app which represents a mobile loyalty card and serves as a sensor for collecting real-time data (incl. environmental ones) and a detector of situations where the customer can be engaged, b) server where all customer data is stored and processed through analytics module in order to update customers profiles and personalize services for engaging the customer and c) web portal for enabling merchant to configure and publish their offers (punchcards) and interact with customers in a more explicit way.

Our proposal aims to create a service which allow users to create decals perfectly suited for their 3D objects. As it is known, the world of 3D printing has focused from the beginning on the shape of objects leaving behind the problem of their coloration. Most of 3D printing options available are restricted to a small handful of basic colors; it is true that recently some 3D printers full color came on the market, but they are quite expensive and professional oriented. Some 3D printing services on line started to offer full color option but not at an affordable price.
Our solution addresses the problem from a different perspective: the coloration is provided by means of decals which are glued on the object after it is printed. Decals are created using an innovative web app which allow to paint over a 3D surface. The finished design is then printed on paper for decal.
Our solution is flexible: decals are applicable to a wide range of materials: FDM, WDM, polyJet etc, provided that the geometry is not too complex.
Our solution is scalable: it can be added as an add-on service to existing on line 3D printing services or it can be used for free by single users that print by themselves the decals.
Our solution is pragmatic: it avoids using expensive technology to color 3D objects; even existing 3D objects can be refreshed with colors. Moreover objects can be repainted by removing existing decals and applying the new decals or simply by overlapping them.
Our solution is innovative: the web app which is part of the solution is designed as a tool which allows everyone to paint digitally a 3D model without 3D solid modelling skills.",Tech provider,0,0,0,X,0,0,,Software,Consumer application,#N/A,#N/A,1,X,www.abertech.it/en,SME,18000,abertech.it

The dental market is one of the key market segments in this framework, presenting ?6.19bn annual turnover in Europe. Dental care products and services do not only improve people?s appearance, but also contribute to have healthier habits. One of the most popular dental products is the orthodontics, since it has a direct visible impact in people?s appearance.

Orthodontics is used to align the teeth and improve i) the smile, ii) eating and biting experiences (occlusion) and iii) self-confidence.
However, wearing orthodontics is low aesthetic; it causes rejection between adolescents but also provokes reactions between grown-up people, who also feel ashamed of wearing metallic brackets in their teeth. In addition, orthodontics is expensive because it is a specific product manually manufactured and tuned for each person. The previous reasons provoke rejection to orthodontics, even if it improves health (occlusion improvement, pain reduction or elimination of headaches produced by malocclusion, among others).

The 3DENT project proposes a complete service to incorporate the use of 3D printing and 3D scanning in dental clinics to create removable and transparent orthodontics to align the teeth and provide the end user a satisfying experience.

Indeed, in many of industries (Aerospace, F1) it's absolutely essential that the manufacturer can ensure whether the parts it 3-D prints are free from any defects. In the traditional manufacturing metrology is used for quality control through tactile measuring devices which is usually a time consuming (and costly) process. 
In this proposal we present an integrated approach for quality control in additive manufacturing (3D printing) that relays on 3D scanning process as the metrology process. Once the part has been built they are inspected using the 3D scanning equipment to determine their accuracy or more general to calculate the so called deviation map between the model and the produced part. The quality control data collected is analytically processed in order to define different types of reports related to the quality of the product or efficiency of the process.
The main outcome is the 3DQuality System that can be used as a Solution as a Service for improving quality control in 3D printing processes. It can be used as a) a notification tool which detects timely the problems in the 3D printing process and informs responsible workers about the status of printing or b) an analytics tool that aggregates problems (esp. negative trends) and informs responsible managers about deviation in the printing process. 
The proposal build upon FITMAN Smart Factory SEs and has a very strong impact on additive manufacturing. The main innovation is related to the possibility to process operational data produced in 3D printing process very fast and in a complex way using Big/Fast data processing technologies, esp. CEP (Complex Event Processing).

3D-REVOPRINT aims to connect public accessible or private used 3D-printers to the web and to enable the commercial use of them. Owners of 3D-printers will profit from the accessible network through an increase of 3D print-job requests, a balanced workload and an optimized flow rate. End-users, on the other side, will benefit from time and cost savings and can furthermore request their 3D print-outs on the go (mobile) and nearby. 
Our existing start-up company REVOPRINT itself is an expert for the establishment of such distributed networks to ensure a win-win value chain. As of today REVOPRINT runs a print shop platform with access to over 90 print-shops in 43 cities. These print shops have a strong interest in offering a 3D-printing service in addition to their regular portfolio. With our database of over 1500 print shops, REVOPRINT has the ability to implement 3D-printing in a huge market and could internationalize the topic throughout Europe.
Technically speaking, the challenge is to synchronize and build up interfaces for the variety of 3D-printer models and their unique functionalities, e.g. use of materials, multi-color printing, printing speed etc. Furthermore, it is important to make them accessible through the web so that workload and workflow can become automatized.
Therefore, the technical innovation has two sides: automatized 3D print-queuing in a distributed network and on the other side price calculation based on the 3D print file data and further varying factors.

In this sense 3DSquare points directly to the sectors (automotive, consumer products, medical?) that in the coming years will be introducing 3D printing and will need robust and traceable processes to assure the dimensional quality of their manufactured goods. Limitations of the 3D printing process derive in the need of post-printed machining to achieve the required dimensional quality. So, TRIMEK, by 3DSquare project, aims to open a new service to the 3D printing sector integrating 3D optical scanning and certified measuring software with FI based enablers to continuously increase the printing quality reducing the machining phase. Firstly, 3D Scanning will digitalise of the entire surface of the printed part. Then, M3 software process the data, reporting the comparison of the real part with the CAD model envisioned and building deviation maps. Afterwards, information will be exploited in to create correlation program (at printing and CAD model level) that loops feedback to improve constantly the printing quality. If needed, this information will be used to drive the final machining phase. To achieve these, TRIMEK will exploit FIWARE web and cloud technologies. 3DScan, 3DCWV offers the possibility of visualizing the 3D digitalized parts. DinamicCEP processes the data to provide correlation results. Object Storage gives the opportunity to store the files generated by the digitalization of the printed objects in appropriate containers in the cloud. Finally, IdentityManager KeyRock provides security to the whole system with authentication.

The site will be a marketplace, bringing together end customers (consumers and businesses) and file contributors (Manufacturers and 3D designers) to provide unlimited access to many types of spare parts, simply by printing them in a local 3D printer. For consumers, trying to obtain a rare or obsolete part for a beloved toy or broken appliance can be frustrating; for manufacturers, a missing part on a production line can cost millions of dollars in lost manufacturing time while waiting for the part to be delivered. Kazzata provides a quick, low-cost and environmentally-friendly option to have the needed spare part printed on-demand and locally on a 3D printer. 
Innovation: Current spare parts supply chains are complex and expensive. Our solution disrupts the traditional spare part supply chain. When there is a demand for a spare part in a certain location on the globe, instead of flying the part form on corner of the globe to the other (which is expansive and takes time) you can simply print it in a local 3D printing service bureau. 
We will build this repository along three axes: 
Obtaining files directly from manufacturers who will partner with us and direct their clients to use our services whenever they need a spare part. Our service might be white labeled for the specific manufacturer of the spare part
Obtaining original design-files from 3D designers 
Obtaining files designed on demand for spare parts based on requests initiated by end users on the Kazzata site
Our business model is predicated on our owning or licensing the CAD files for the long term, generating revenue (which will be shared with the manufacturer) each time a file is purchased or downloaded.

Most 3D printing companies, on the other hand, struggle to find enough customers to obtain a sufficient return on their investment. Also, they often need to spend time making models printable.

Research shows that the European 3D printing industry will grow in the near future, which will result in a significant increase of the demand for a smoother interaction between both 3D printing content providers and 3D printing companies. 

Layered Prints aims to develop software (an API) that bridges the gap between both groups and tackles their specific challenges. It will enable the 3D printing content providers and their customers (end-users) to have the most appropriate 3D printing company automatically selected in terms of price, physical distance and specific printing material needs. 

The software will allow 3D printing content providers to offer their end-customers a streamlined 3D printing service whilst they keep focus on their core business. They will enjoy a quick, safe and eco-friendly printing and order fulfilment. 

The printing companies, on the other hand, will benefit from a greater return on their investment as they will get more customers without having to put in the effort themselves.

Initially, the web interface allows the user to customize the lattice structure by adjusting parameters such as knot density, typical rod length, rod thickness, regularity etc. Later, the web interface will be coupled to advanced state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, which will assist the user in designing optimized lattices for specific requirements.

To shorten the time to market, the service will use FIWARE. Meshify requires a web-based 3D user-interface (UI), cloud-based management of resources, and a webshop interface. These can all be translated into FIWARE enablers. In SML1, the UI will be implemented based on a FIWARE generic enabler from the category ?Advanced web-based UI?. In SML2, the scalability of the solution is assured by using the enablers in the category ?Cloud infrastructure?. In SML3, a webshop is attached using the enabler Store-WStore.

SAMGO could be described as an online copy shop where users can scan and print 3D copies of almost every object.
To generate a 3D model of the object, different sensor systems will be supported for acquiring the necessary data. The SAMGO web platform is aiming for easy to use sensors like digital cameras, smart phones and gaming console sensors, which potential clients may already have at home. Uploaded data are automatically processed and converted into 3D models while the web platform offers several tools for optimizing these models for 3D printing. SAMGO also provides a 3D printing service, which enables customers to directly order a 3D printed version of their created model.
Realizing SAMGO, several FIWARE Generic Enablers (GE) and Specific Enablers (SE) will be utilized. In particular the 3DScan SE, provided by FITMAN, will be used for 3D visualisation of point clouds and meshes. Furthermore, the SAMGO platform will benefit from 3D file storage management tools which are included in the 3DScan SE. SAMGO will also provide user authentication using the Identity Management ? KeyRock (GE). Processing the large amounts of data, the SAMGO back-end will profit from the BigData Analysis ? Cosmos (GE). In order to handle the connection of different sensor types, the Backend Device Management ? IDAS (GE) will be favourable. The FIWARE Store ? WStore (GE) is suitable to implement the SAMGO web shop.
The major innovations of the SAMGO web platform are found in covering the entire process from data acquisition to 3D printing in a unified web portal. In particular, providing a common interface for different low-cost sensor devices and the development of innovative algorithms for data processing and model optimization are expected to lead to a significant impact on the consumer market.",Service provider,0,0,0,0,X,X,,Software,Consumer application,#N/A,#N/A,1,X,0,SME,18000,indmatec.com

Shoes have traditionally been considered a fashion complement when, in fact, they should have been considered a health complement. Many people have come to us to find relief for their afflictions, which were often the consequence of using inappropriate shoes.

Many people who do not use healthy shoes do so because of aesthetic concerns. They prefer to endure pain in their feet, their back or their joints rather than using shoes that do not agree with their aesthetic preferences.

When making shoes, the traditional way of considering a shoe as a whole unit leads to waste of materials. The Open Shoes concept implies making the shoes modular, dividing each shoe in three parts: The midsole (the most important part), the insole (which gives a better feeling to the soles of the feet) and the outer shell. One set with a full range of midsoles and insoles is enough to create all of our shoes. In that way we reduce significantly the use of material and resources.

The most important thing is for the midsole to be as customizable as possible, so that it can spread the pressure along the soles of the feet, absorb impacts, and adjust to each user according to their physical characteristics (mostly their height, the width of their feet and their weight). To do that a public repository will be created by means of repository-sap-ri. At the same time, designs will be made available to the general community in object-storage-ge-fi-ware-implementation, and users will be able to improve it by means of interface-designer. In this way, every user, by means of 3D printing, will be able to create their own midsoles and complement them with the necessary outer shells and insoles.

The strength of Wop3D lies in the innovative purchasing system: users can't buy any model, nor printable, nor
generic license, but just acquire the right to print once the required object. This system will free the designers from
costs in protecting their works, still having some sort of protection of intellectual property, hence assuring an
income chance. On the other hand, people interested in buying have a benefit from low, scalable prices that varies
depending on the chosen object and on the required quantity.
Wop3D will extensively use some of the Fiware technologies both in the Web Site (enablers for developing the

Such application could ease the spreading of 3D printing, since low prices intrigue buyers and incentive to try out
the service. In addition, printing a flawed model does not generate frustration. The limited time in which you get
the objects, associated with a wide range and competitive prices will affect the printer market, thereby enlarging
more and more the buying audience.

Aiming to make it happen and to respond to the growing market within which is this technology at the beginning of 2016. Within this project SLM 3D technology, was born the need to develop software capable of facilitating the approach of this technology to the end user. 
This project showed us clearly that currently in the 3D printing for metal parts (SLM) market, manufacturers of products for different industries where this technology has many advantages, are facing several major problems and few solutions. Problems: system, products and staff are very different from those commonly used. No previous experience within the company and little beyond. 
This creates two major drawbacks to the user of 3D printing technology: excessive costs and deadlines.
Our project 3DMEPASMO, want to be an cooperative and innovative software based in FIWARE Generic Enables that checks and optimizes geometrical structures generated by CAD before transmitted to the 3D printing machine , particularly focused on metallic parts (SLM ) for the aerospace and medical market. There will result in a refined and optimized version of the input data, which allow optimum manufacturing 3D metallic parts. This software open a multitude of new advantages for design engineers of metal parts. This results in better cost and deadlines for the 3D metal parts manufacturers.

After working with its own resources and conducting an intense research and development in a completely new and still unexplored field, it eventually developed and patented its own methodology to regenerate batteries. PATENT: P201331851 What does battery regeneration imply? When a battery starts to misfire, it means that some of its modules start to misfire, and this failure can reach the other modules. Bluelife Battery has developed a series of analysis techniques that allow us to conduct specific actions, as well as its own methodology, to regenerate the battery and carry out its fine tuning so that it can be still used, putting it back in the active circuit and considerably reducing its environmental impact. We have succeeded in regenerating more than 350 batteries, which have proven that our method works, and the best evidence of this are the satisfied customers themselves, as well as the regenerated batteries, which propel the hybrid vehicles of our customers. The accumulated experience and, above all, the development of a deep knowledge of battery functioning, problems, breakdowns and reliability allowed us to come up with the idea of designing our own batteries. We had detected a necessity on the market and we were able to meet it. Thanks to our experience, we were able to develop our own system of batteries, characterised by their greater capacity, lower failure rate and longer durability, what we consider a step forward in the appropriate technological direction. We are talking about modules with a durability which is six-fold higher than the one of Toyotas current models: ~200,000km. vs 750,000km. We have already received the first prototypes and we are developing two important processes in parallel, in order to consolidate the product; on the one hand, the launch and installation of the first unit in a vehicle to test the stress in the street and, on the other hand, we are going to start a certification process with INTA (the National Institute of Aerospace Technology) in order to guarantee, scientifically and neutrally, the durability of the modules. Both processes are aimed at launching the product and consolidating it on the market. Moreover, Bluelife Battery, a company committed to the environment and sustainability, is also investing resources to provide thrown-out batteries with a second useful life. We want to use them in renewable energy projects, as a storage system. Many of these batteries do not have enough power to propel an electric vehicle, but they do keep their capacity to store energy for other electric processes, especially if we regenerate them and make modular blocks with them (since these are static systems, size is not important and it is possible to use blocks made up of several battery sets), in order to multiply the storage capacity, closing the circle of sustainability and reducing the environmental impact and waste.",#N/A,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

If you had problems in some fingers or in your complete hand, it will not be amazing that you can move a bionic- Hand just using our wearable device? Just by micro-gestures. We know that your mind will not stop think about the possibilities. The idea came up about four years ago, when a well-known brand produced the Kinect system. From that moment on, a new future opened in front of us. We started thinking on the huge possibilities that this new system could offer in the future. The problem rose up in the moment we researched more about it and realized how limited it was. That is when we started considering about the possibility of developing that system and how to improve it or otherwise how to develop new and more efficient and accurate systems of gesture reception. From that moment different markets and enormous possibilities opened up for our product. The main and first aim of the project is to get the highest possible number of people wearing our smart bracelets permanently, provided that they offer different services depending on where the user may be ( in or outside home, on the car, etc.). This is why we would like our product to have an usage similar to that of the mobile phone nowadays, which is in our pocket all the ]me. The main aim is to control different electronic appliances, either at home (windows, light switchers, TV, airwrimng for different devices...) and outside home (helping us loca]ng ourselves, finding places without watching to any screen, using devices inside our car which would help tourists when in foreign countries, etc.) Currently we are developing the new technology of micro-gesture recep]on to offer the possibility of gesture-writing. The same technology, in a near future, will serve to obtain the highest accuracy on clinical surgery and even allow single-handed people to control a biomechanical hand just using our smart bracelet.

So technicians involved in advance diagnostics and maintenance typically must use many weighty and thick manuals to find out the necessary information and procedures during their work and must constantly look at alternatively their hands and the diagnostic tools. This way of working is very inefficient and it may lead to human errors, main cause of industrial accidents (several surveys have reported statistical data showing that more than 70 percent of current industrial accidents are caused by human errors). In order to reduce human errors and consequently reduce the accidents, a recent approach in safety field is based on the adoption of the so-called proactive approach which includes primarily policies and procedures.

The company was founded by two Ph.D., Andrea Carcano (holding a Ph.D. in Cybersecurity and InfoSec expert) and Moreno Carullo (holding a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering expert). Nozomi main focus is the development of products for protecting, monitoring and troubleshooting Industrial networks with a particular focus on energy systems and smart grid. In the latest years, Industrial Critical Installations started to use massively network interconnections, and what it is worst they came in contact with the public network, i.e. with Internet. The net effect of such new trend, is the introduction of a new interleaved and heterogeneous architecture combining typical information system (e.g. data bases, web-servers, web-applications and web-activities), with real-time elements implementing the control functions of industrial plants. If, from a certain point of view, the advantages of such complex architectures are several (remote management functions, distributed con-trol and management systems, on the fly monitoring etc. ), on the other hand they intro-duce a new layer of exposure to malicious threats. These specialized hardware and software equipment used in these critical installations (eg. Smart grids, power plants, pipeline etc.) often communicate with specialized protocols engineered with availability, speed and reliability in mind. InfoSec issues are, however, often not covered thus leaving such critical protocols (Modbus, IEC-61850-5-101/104, MMS, GOOSE, SampledValues, etc) and architectures (IEC 61850) with open flaws for a wide range of cyberattacks. In addition, day-by-day operation can be seriously impacted by hardware or software malfunction that in such distributed scenarios can be really hard to detect and recover quickly. Both these two scenarios need an integrated, advanced external monitoring system able to detect and record system failures, with integrated tools supporting operators in recovering the system and preventing future incidents. We have envisioned a platform, the Nozomi Industrial Global Critical State Guardian (IGCSG), currently composed by two different products: Nozomi SCADAguardian (SG) and Nozomi Industrial Event Monitor (IEM). The first has already been developed by Nozomi and the latter will be developed thanks to INCENSE/FIWARE resources.

3167,INCE161,INCE,INCENSe,The Netherlands,Savve B.V.,Savve Simply Saving Energy,0,0,0,#N/A,-,NO,0,#N/A,"//Type of business // Savve is an online marketplace that gives advice to consumers looking to improve the energy efficiency and comfort of their home and connects them with installers. //Company summary // Savve is a software solution consisting of a website and app. Savve uses an in-house developed algorithm to accurately estimate the savings potential of existing buildings in a matter of seconds. Consumers enter just their zip code and house number to receive a free tailor-made advice suggesting what energy saving solutions to install. Examples of products Savve sells to consumers are: wall- floor insulation, CV boilers, solar panels (PV). Savve also supports the installer with software developed for mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) that will increase efficiency and lower sales marketing costs. Savve coordinates the entire process from advice to installation while taking as many business processes online as possible. //Already creating real market value through validated learning// We are already helping customers and generating revenues and hence creating real market value. We have validated the problem and the right solution through Lean Startup methodologies. Now that we are getting traction we need capital to develop Savves disruptive online platform to its full potential using innovative internet technologies. This should push software technology forward while both the installer and consumer will benefit and homes become more sustainable. //Mission:// We want to be the number one company for energy saving solutions and make homes more sustainable by making choices for consumers simple and installation for craftsmen easy. //Added value// The savings-check (ƒ??Bespaarcheckƒ?) of the online marketplace provides consumers with insight in their savings potential. Information is presented in a way that enables consumers to easily compare and select the right energy savings solution(s). It shows how much can be saved and what the return on their investment will be. Savve creates transparency in an industry where price and brand comparison are difficult and time consuming and the differences in installer pricing and quality are not transparent. Savve will also develop intuitive, user-friendly software for installers running on mobile devices. This will reduce acquisition- marketing costs for the small installation companies because it enables Savve to take over their sales and marketing resulting in larger sales volumes. Future versions of the software will also reduce administration time by simplifying the current difficult-to-use software that most of the time runs on desktops designed for larger companies. Savve will make this low-operational excellence market more efficient to take a big step towards a more sustainable future. Savve can improve efficiency with an estimated 7-25% for roughly 25000 installers of ƒ??greenƒ? solutions in the Netherlands. //Management team and staff// The start-up management team combines an engineering background in relevant areas, experience in business development and sound financial expertise. //Business system// Savve is a 2-sided marketplace in the home energy efficiency market. Consumers get advice and insight for free but pay for the transaction of turnkey products. Savve then pays the installers for materials and work. Installers pay a commission for leads to consumers that have shown interest in a solution. Savve first focuses on R D and software development to achieve a successful proof-of-concept in collaboration with installers in a chosen region (e.g. in the Netherlands). Once the proof-of-concept is demonstrated, Savve will focus more on sales, marketing and operational efficiency and launch nationally. Savve will generate three streams of revenue: ƒ?? Leads (selling details of registered consumers) ƒ?? Orders (sales of turnkey products to consumers) ƒ?? SaaS subscriptions (monthly revenue from sales of software) Competitive edge Savve distinguishes from Dutch competition by coordinating the entire process from advice to installation. Savves competitive edge is three-fold: 1. Integral analysis of entire energy system vs. partial analysis of e.g. solar PV ƒ§? Leading to an all-round advice with larger efficiency gains 2. Rating system for both buyers (consumers) and sellers (installers) ƒ§? Sets high quality standards 3. Developing user-friendly, intuitive software for installers for mobile devices ƒ§? Improving operational efficiency and increasing switching costs //Disruptive business model// Savve has the potential not just to grow into a large company but also to develop into an industry changer and radically change the installation sector. The disruptive force of its business model has the power to turn a low operational excellence installation market into a major marketplace. In conclusion, the profitability of Savve will be substantial due to the low-cost structure and scalability that will generate high shareholders value. It can become the number one company for energy saving solutions at home, based on the superior qualities of our online marketplace, generating attractive savings for consumers and increased efficiency for installers while maintaining high-quality standards.",#N/A,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

The initial idea was formulated during a brainstorm competition in IBM is 2012, where it was formulated and entered as a business concept for IBMs beacon award. It won their global contest, and was award the price as (link to youtube below). The entire concept was a reflection on knowledge developed since 2007, and triggered by a reflection that energy monitoring systems, despite how advanced, does not sell. Energy consumption has become increasingly important to individuals and industries over the last decade, but all Industrial focused Energy monitoring suffers, and hasnt delivered on the initial goal and ambitions. The core of the problem lies in customer perceived value. Delivering details on how bad and costly a given activity is to run, doesnt give value if actions to rectify the problem is enforced. The international recognized standard for doing something ƒ?? ISO50.001, is based on the core assumption that expert knowledge and resources are allocated, whereby appropriate actions, measures and investment are facilitated. All of the above dictates access to trained and experienced experts, which increase costs and creates a high dependency on labor. Conclusion: Bottlenecks on human resources drives cost up, individual skillsets becomes vital, and customer uncertainty increases. SC Nordics novel approach to this is to implement an layer of expert knowledge software onto of existing meters and data acquisition software. This can be accomplished by recognizing that the same 8-10 type of appliances drives a minimum of 75% of consumption across the industry. The goal is to implementation expert knowledge of individual appliances into server based software, so it can be provided as packaged solutions (apps and widgets) for given installations. Example: An industrial compressor will be fitted with a consumption meter, flow and pressure sensors. The expert software will constantly monitor consumption of air, power and calculate the efficiency of this individual compressor. Matched against similar setups and based on consumption profiles and company opening hours, the operate is given a simple 1-100 figure to relate to. If it falls out of accepted performance the software is triggered and provides details report, suggestions and calculations on potential savings. A service organization can even be trigged automatically, and assist the client. This concept has been presented to a number of potential clients, and the conclusion has been that 60-80% of consumption can managed by: 1. Grundfos from 10-12 modules (compressed air, cooling, heating, lighting, idle load, smartgrid, load) 2. IBMs hosting centers can be managed from 4-5 modules (cooling, load, smartgrid, insulation) 3.

The environmental impacts of irrigation relate to the changes in quantity and quality of soil and water as a result of irrigation and the effects on natural and social conditions in river basins and downstream of an irrigation scheme. Day by day the electricity consumption is rapidly increased over the world. The need of a break into solution for efficient water and electrical power management is of massive importance. The aforementioned in brief were the 2 keys of the idea conception. The main two targeted domains of applicability are the Agricultural and the Home Intelligence domain. The innovation that can really characterize and differ from common smart homes and automated irrigation systems is that everything occured under sensitive processing, steps, loops and parameters. Moreover we succesfully integrated into our solution satellite data (data fusion - SAR, optical etc.) which is actually another asset of our solution. The ƒ??sensitivityƒ? is a totally new designation for a M2M network and it refers to the information that we want to propagate. Sensitive M2M communication has to deal with the information, which can be characterized by its volume, security, speed, autonomy, priority etc. This information is the main object of two or more machines/systems that communicate. Utilizing the aforementioned information we can save water electrical power and several sources of energy. The proposed idea can be applied for both Farming and Home Intelligence domains (Agricultural and Domestic applications). The system can be described by Hardware and Software (will be analyzed in other sections) module, where every component is independent system independent of local environment and constitutes a complete smart grid. This SIS-M2M system consists of one Intelligent Box, which is actually the processinf-operational-decision centre that can automatically communicate under a sensitive way with a large group of sensors, systems and machines. The sensitive way that mentioned above is the reason why M2M communication can become special and can be described as a Co-interactive Communication (CiC) under specific group of programming scripts. The whole networked-system will be developed under common systems and protocols such as: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi module, GSM GPS module, Serial communication, I2C protocol, A/D conversion etc. The SIS-M2M application will be able to sense the needs of every system with an intelligent way recording the water and electricity consumption within predefined thresholds (thresholds and needs set by Consumers). For instance an installed soil moisture probe in a corn farm will be able to automatically communicate with the irrigation system and rural drilling machine in order to start the irrigation when the soil is ƒ??thirstyƒ?. The next step is that the soil moisture probe will inform the Intelligent Box that the moisture level is ƒ??OKƒ? in order to stop the irrigation. This can save large amounts of water and make farming intelligent under IoT and M2M frameworks. Additionally we will exploit our know-how of soil moisture retrieval from satellite optical and SAR imagery to upgrade our system. The Intelligent Box will be able to receive data from the installed sensors and satellite data. With an automated way (our algorithm) soil moisture will be also estimated from sat images, whicah can act as a confirmation or the major parameter in larger farms. Thousands of Gallons can be saved with this preocedure. The SIS-M2M system can easily adopted from the Home Intelligence domain. It constitutes an transferrable technology with high intercompatibility independent systems. Smart Homes with special automation were something incredible 10 years ago. With our sensitive proposal we can create special features and apply out intelligent system in homes or existent smart applications for Home automation (thermostat can easily integrated-utilized in SIS-M2M system). The reason why we offer innovative solution is that the user will be able to control everything from his smartdevice or his PC with a simple application. He will be able to interfere to the system according to his needs by predefining the thresholds of the system (both for agricultural and domestic domain). The application can be simply installed in smart devices (smartphones, smartwatches, etc) by offering remote control of sources management with real time need records.",#N/A,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

(www.navdy.com) The type and dimensions of the used vehicle is previously programmed in parking process apps of the smart phone. The garage computer receives the information what vehicle (size, weight) is expected. The SMART CITY also informs the garage computer about the exact time when the vehicle will reach the entrance terminal based on the real evaluated movement through traffic. There are places in the garage marked, equipped and defined for leaving and taking the vehicle t e r m i n a l s. The vehicles are left on the first available terminal in the garage. The driver leaves the car. From that moment on, the garage computer is responsible for the vehicle. During the operation GALE guides the TRPE-s under the vehicle. TRPE-s are raising and then carrying the car to the place of previously determined exact parking spot. The whole process is reversed during the return of the vehicle to the user. While not working, the robots are moved to predefined place and connected to the grid for recharging. During the whole process the engine of the parked car is not working. Unlike other systems for automating parking, where parking places are dimensioned for the largest vehicles, in this case there is possibility for completely economization of the available space. The maximum modular structure of the system offers high level of redundancy and readiness . All mechanical modules of the System GALE, TRPE, elevators and vehicle entrance and exit terminals are relatively simple, and integrated from standardized parts. The system is relatively easy to manufacture and maintenances with long service life. All other elements in the system are software. Any software is very flexible and easy to develop, improve, upgrade and replace within FI-PPP. The whole system of parking area, has only smooth leveled concrete floor without other complicated elements and structures. The parking is networked within SMART CITY cloud in FIWARE environment. Open source architecture offers opportunity for major optimization of the processes, save time, space, energy, provides user friendly service, less pollution during operation and it is versatile in every aspect. The manipulation robot is consisted of four operating elements TRPE that transport, lift and position the vehicle. The fifth element is the intelligent robot GALE- which manages and monitors the manipulation process on the site. The four TRPE elements are in constant WIFI and sensor connection between each other and also with the fifth element GALE which manages the whole movement process. All elements are synchronized and move through the parking in several predefined mutual formations depending of the situation. If there is necessity for changing the floor level, then the elevator is used. GALE has the ability for the vehicle dimension recognizing and immediately compares the vehicle with the stored data from the garage computer car database, information from the smart phone of the owner, as well as recognition of the vehicle at the point of reception. From to the database info for the car type, dimensions and characteristics of the vehicles, GALE and TRPE robots determine the approach trajectory, the approach patch and how to raise the vehicle for which predefined routines are written , according to the configuration of the garage. GALE and TRPE robots control and maintain the relative position between each other and the surrounding space with use of sensors. GALE is in constant communication with the garage computer and orients in space by local GPS network at each floor level, triangulating on the required number of transponders or through a wired network in the floor. All communications and payments for the service will be performed electronically. The parking space is under complete surveillance and all security elements are constantly monitored. .",#N/A,,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,0,#N/A,0,#N/A

However the economical benefit is relatively small, the size of the investment taken into account. On the other hand, it is possible to create a large scale economical benefit by trading grains at the right time with an up-to-date risk management strategy. The AgroCockpit app supply the farmer with a professionel and up-to-date trading strategy, that makes sure, he takes advatage of favorable price trends in the grain market. Description of App - version 1.0 The AgroCockpit app makes it easy for farmers to manage their price related risk despite difficult market conditions, through automacialy robot generated and up-to-date risk management strategies. The app is developed for growers and sellers of grains as well as for buyers of grains and animal feed ? hence arable farming as well as livestock production. Targeting market The targeting market is farmers worldwide selling or buying grains. Initially, the targeting market is European farmers. The AgroCockpit app is, however, equally applicable for rice producers in China, coffee producers in South America, farmers in developing countries, as it is for soy producers and cattle breeders in the United States. All farmers world wide are subject to the extreme price fluctuations and therefore need to proactively manage the price related risk.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

The system is intended to sense soil moisture and will support the farmer in taking optimal decisions to streamline his precision agriculture (PA) processes. Currently, soil moisture is either measured locally by on-the-site measurement equipment, which is costly, time consuming and provides only local information, or by means of satellites, which is also costly, difficult to deploy on demand and delivers data with coarse resolution only. A breakthrough in the remote measurement of soil moisture could be achieved by mounting radar sensors on drones, i.e. remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS). Data collected from such a system could be collected in real-time, processed and utilized for the management of PA processes.

This data will be shared through the FI space platform with other farmers and consultants. This will allow farmers to allocate the correct amount of grass to their herd per grazing event. The app will be monitised in two ways:- 1. A small initial charge for downloading the app. onto smartphone or other mobile device. (?1 /?2 suggested) 2. Advertising revenue. As information on the quantity of grass available to farmers is known, when compiled and analysed it makes a larger over-all regional and national picture. Oversupply farmers are natural customers for input suppliers (plastic, silage additive, forage traders) while under supply farmers may require feed, fertiliser, better grass cultivars or additional forage. Two apps will be created - both of which are already at design document stage (see attachment):- The first app will summarise the amount of available grass on the farm through a simple 'wedge' graph. The farmer inputs the data (grass cover per paddock) which is then computed and displayed in a quantity of grass per paddock. When data input is finished this completed data is assembled and displayed in graphical form and stored for reference. The referencing the graph the farmer can make decisions as the actual grass supply is displayed against 'idea'l grass supply. If over-supplied the farmer can make silage witht hte excess etc or if under-supplied then the farmer can feed supplementary feed etc. The second app. is used by farmers to allocate grass to the herd per grazing event (12 hourly/ daily etc). By inputting the grass cover and the number of cows to be fed the app will display the farmers the areas required. Using the GPS function of the phone the phone then signals the farmer then the correct beginning point to erect the temperory fence is reached.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

Also in other European countries a lot of farmers operate on a small scale. Often they cannot afford to buy expensive equipment such as harvesters or another advanced equipment and agricultural machinery. Presently, in Polish villages it is customary to use the services of more affluent farmers who have the necessary equipment. Often, such people despite their willingness, are not able to help everyone during harvest time at short notice. Some wealthy farmers, when they realize that they have a monopoly on this type of services in their area, tend to increase prices. Unfortunately, not all farmers are able to meet the costs. Limitation to choosing only from among people from in the closest area and lack of awareness of offers from farmers from neighbouring villages, is the current state of things in Polish villages. A common problem can also be matching the machinery size to the size of the field. For example a large harvester cannot work in small fields. Conversely, small harvesters become unprofitable on larger fields. However, the lack of choice of other machines, and the lack of knowledge of farmers about offers from other people results in having no other choice than using only their closest neighbours? offers. Our application is intended for small and medium-sized farmers who do not have large or advanced agricultural machines. Such machines are expensive and can be afforded only by the large-scale farmers. However, as all farmer need to cultivate their land, smaller farms have to use more services in order to maintain their production. So far those services are provided among people who know each other. One large farmer often has a monopoly on this type of services in his area and either demands high prices or is not able to help all farmers from the nearest area. This issue can be solved by our portal. It allows to create offers for agricultural services, which increases competitiveness and also gives opportunity for large-scale farmers to plan the work. On the other hand our solution offers smaller farmers the possibility to choose the best offers of agricultural services. Also the smaller farmers may publish notices they have a demand for specific services and equipment, and then choose the best offer. This solution allows to reduce the costs for small farms, which is very important for their small budgets. Moreover, thanks to the development of such a system, all farmers can improve their management plans for their farms.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,1,0,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A

Our predictive models are very sectorized regarding competition because there are no so specialized solutions. In addition, it covers the transformation area, productive needs and logistic and sales capacities as well as human capital. The way of commercialization will consist of offering a service in the cloud and a personalized scorecard to companies of this sector for the decision making. To do this, we take into account not only previous campaign production results but also future scenarios depending on trend of macroeconomic, social, politic, market and sectoral indicators. To attract companies weïll undertake diffusion campaigns of target service. This service is characterized by ?pay per use? once it has been parameterized and personalized. Therefore, the intention is that companies contract consulting services for the interpretation of the data, the implementation of action plans and the improvement of the competitiveness. In addition, it will be provided more services in the cloud such as access information of the sector, observatory, positioning in several parameters?that will be contracted separately. The aim is a company can contract this service by internet as well as beginning enjoying it within fifteen once the company includes the requirement information to personalize its casuistry. The business model proposed here is a company (Actua2)-dependent business line that allows a parameterization and personalization service of the tool in remote control taking into account that the solution is installed in a datacenter. When the service is contracted by internet, a consultant will contact the client to request the necessary data to register the new company in the solution hosted in the data center.

At the moment this industry is in crisis once again. Firstly, in Ireland all farmers can?t be dairy farmers because of circumstances, so the Beef / Suckler farmer is sometimes the only option and sometimes the preferred option or a way of life. For Example Ireland: Beef is a natural resource to Ireland and very significant part of Irish exports. Ireland has arguably the most stringent and best regulated Beef industry in the world with full back to birth traceability, highest quality, and highest level of animal welfare. Under the current system, the Irish Beef industry will continue fire-fighting, going from one crisis to the next. There is too many variables, costs continue to rise year and year while revenues are unknown and market driven. Beef Farmers have no control of finance, cash-flows, banking to name a few and their ability to stay in business has become a yearly gamble. Beef factories too have to contend with an unpredictable supply and quality, which forces commodity type pricing. These are some reasons for this ongoing beef crisis. We must refine this industry. The Solution The BEEFMARKET is an interactive website with a large database facility and mobile app compatible with android and apple devices, which benefit both the farmer and factory. The BEEFMARKET is an advance booking system for farmers to book their beef cattle to their chosen factory based on a ?minimum price? contract. The BEEFMARKET is a real time forecasting system for all factories within the system. The BEEFMARKET website will display ?minimum price? offers from all factories (within the system) based on killing dates up to a minimum of 3 months. Once the farmer is satisfied with a price/offer, he can lock into a ?minimum price? contract with the chosen factory. The BEEFMARKET is compatible with the CMMS (department animal database), therefore the farmer can highlight and upload his herd details on the BEEFMARKET website using his own secure login.

Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are undoubtedly the single-most valuable animal pollinators to agriculture because they can be easily maintained and transported to pollinator-dependent crops. It is well documented that 76% of the production of food for human consumption is dependent on the beekeeping sector and 84% of vegetable species cultivated in Europe depend on pollination. Even though sharp regional declines in honey bee populations have occurred in the past, the magnitude and velocity of recent declines are shocking. The collapse in the global honeybee population is a major threat to crops and it is a product of multiple and often interacting factors. Beekeeping in EU27 is practiced mainly traditionally with little progress to report over the last 30-40 years in terms of innovation in techniques, methodologies or business practices and so it maintains an extensive rather than intensive nature. One of the primary constraints towards automation and intensification of the processes involved beekeeping has been the physical impossibility of beekeepers adequately recording beehive inspection and production data. Our proposed solution is a mobile phone application and web service, which will enable beekeepers worldwide to: i. Record, monitor and analyze production related data of beehives via a Voice User Interface (VUI)-guided, structured and optimized beehive inspection routine ii.

If the aggregated heterogeneity of soil is combined with historic crop biomass heterogeneity, then we have a frame and diagnose to represent the spatial variation in crop performance in a field, with under- and outperforming zones. We will have a 3 step approach. Step 1 is the input of historic data on soil, biomass and yield heterogeneity. Step 2 delivers the diagnose map on which underperforming, average and outperforming parts of the field are shown. This information is used to propose management zones. In Step 3, management zones are linked to rates of important inputs, such as seeding density, some fertilizer and soil herbicides rates, as well as different tilling practices.

This implies higher cost (and in some regions also unavailability) of the solutions, based on the wireless sensor network technology, as well as lower flexibility of the solution in terms of network topology changes and network expansion. Elmitel Sensing addresses this drawback and turns wireless sensor network set-up into a process that can be accomplished by non-IT personnel (like farmers), because this recently became possible and feasible with the availability of modular hardware and IoT cellular plans. The consequence is a wireless sensor network that costs less and is more flexible and easier to upgrade, while all of the data processing for particular crop is done in the cloud. Supported sensor network hardware is already available in the EU and globally.",Tech provider,0,X,0,0,0,X,,Hardware,Services Operations Management,Applications,Operations and Manufacturing Applications,1,X,0,SME,40000,elmitel.com

The problem is that there exists no system for the farmers, which combines the automated feeding as well as the management of the feeding process.

Furthermore, intensification is threatened as there is less herdsman and many of them are lacking traditional pasture management knowledge or having hard time to intensify their extensive farms. On the other hand there are many potential new sources of scientific data and new information-technology-communication tools (ITC) which are unutilized so far in the livestock systems. There are sensors available to track the movement of animals (GPS, telemetry), follow their health condition (temperature, bio acoustic) or to geo-localize them through GIS based maps.

The Greening Application (GAPP) proposal deals with the green direct payment in a way that it deploys an ICT product that facilitates the European agricultural producers to comply with the greening demands of the new CAP. Specifically, the GAPP ICT product includes two applications, i.e., the EFA Calculator and the Crop Diversifier. The first application checks whether an agricultural producer possesses the required amount of EFAs that excuses the green direct payment. In case of non-conformance, it suggests actions that have to be taken in order the producer to be eligible for this kind of subsidy.

Our approach is based from the perspective of the internet of things leveraging the FI-Ware platform. Increase in the cost of production, abolishment of the quota system will put pressure on dairy farmers to find new ways to optimize their farm production [1]. Estrus detection is one of the fundamental optimization points in operations and can save farmers significant amounts of money, up to ?250/year per cow. While current detection systems provide adequate accuracy, they are mostly based on algorithms designed for indoor/shed base farms. Furthermore, the business model is based on monolithic implementations based on devices that require fixed capital investments. These systems are usually out of reach of small to medium sized farms. Also, the technology is fixed and cannot be adapted to changing farmer needs and scale.

This problem concerns particularly small farms are not engaged in the large-scale production, but their production output happens to exceed their own needs. An obvious way to deal with over-production is to sell excess products, but the price offered by large purchasers can be significantly lower than the production cost incurred by a small farm. Often, the amount of goods to sell is too low to be accepted by a prospective purchaser. An excessive amount of food is wasted or used as a fodder for farm animals. The solution for this problem is an increasing social requirement for wholesale and ecological food. Restaurants and health food stores are willing to pay more for agricultural products which are produced in harmony with nature. Currently, the prices of eco food are at a very high level, not only due to high production costs but also by high rates of intermediaries, relatively high and ever rising demand and relatively low supply. Therefore, this type of food offered in restaurants is becoming a luxury item.

We are very aware of how busy farmers are and how hard they find it to record data and consume data. We have been providing software on Pocket PCs since 2006 and we are very familiar with what is possible on a Smartphone. We know that all data recording can be done on phones and all data that a farmer might need to manage their herd can also be done on the phone. The 2 big advantages of the phone are the availability outside and the small screen which forces the interface to be very simple. There are really 3 types of herd data a farmer will want to consume: A. All data for 1 cow (easy on a phone) B. List report for a number of cows (easy on a phone) C. Analysis report for the full herd (harder on a phone) In reality farmers want to consume report types A and B for 95% of the time. Using these reports is where the farmer makes positive day to day decisions. The backend database systems that we will be linking to, for data transfer, can already do the harder herd analysis (C) reports. We therefore have a very clear idea of what we want to do, and why. Because of new web service links that are being built at the moment by the backend systems (ICBF in Ireland and VetImpress in UK), this type of project is now possible for the 1st time. The Fispace project interests us for a number of reasons 1. It allows us to use ?out of the box? enablers that will get us moving quicker. 2. It will help us mash up with other systems and allow us to bring more services to our clients in a common platform. 3. It creates a safe environment to co-operate. We have lots of experience in Ireland where the state agency data systems that we share data with, eventually start providing their own software services direct to farmers. This leads to less co-operation rather than more co-operating. 4. The funding is obviously an attraction but funding will be no good if the platform is not solid and easy to work with. 5. It will help the process of us selling more software abroad. It is a networking opportunity. We look forward to seeing how we progress our business using the Fispace platform.

Today on farms, for example in the Spanish olive fields, irrigation is always performed with a fixed time, regardless of the number of hours of sunshine, temperature field throughout the day, soil moisture, etc., so that olives or other species is sometimes over irrigate and in other times is excessively dry because the specified parameters are not controlled and they water always in the same way. Also, within the same field, we can have areas drier than others, and this is ignored too, so it is clear that on the one hand we are wasting water and the other they are leaving plants drier than they should and therefore producing less than it should or shortening its life. With proper irrigation management is the fundamental point that we are addressing our application. In addition, specific Spanish farmers dedicated to olive, bases their economic and care management of the olives on experience and memory, and they havenït tools to calculate the profit margin of their business or alert them to what works have already been made and what is pending, etc. so the support to farmers in their daily operation management is also an important point to which our application is addressing. Our solution proposes have three sensors connected to a microcontroller or single-board computer (Arduino or Raspberry, for example) that will connect to the Internet using Wi-Fi; This solution will be encapsulated so as to be installed by the farmer himself or contract the installation to a third party. Pending the farm size, the farmer put more or less devices that will monitor the farm that will be divided in several zones in function of the farmer necessities, our recommendation is has two devices in each ground hectare. These sensors will upload their information to Fiware platform, so the data will be stored using the Fiware?s APIs data and Internet of Things.

Although this is done according to the crop?s developmental stage little attention is turned to the disease?s epidemiology and dispersal which prevents farmers to optimise plant treatment and reduce environmental side effects. In order to sustain gross margins and to reduce environmental side effects, fungicide inputs in cereals will be optimised to the necessary level in a forecast / prediction / warning system integrating calculation of infection pressure and real time weather data and a field monitoring system. This system will thus provide the best knowledge for farmers and consultants to decide if a treatment in the field is necessary and when. In organic crop production systems few options are available for pest and disease control. In recent years, in particular yellow rust attacks in wheat and triticale have caused severe yield losses. In some varieties total crop failure has resulted in high economic loss as well rapid propagation of weeds, often requiring years of repeated and costly mechanical weed control measures. Therefore, an early warning decision support system for diseases may enable the organic farmer at an early stage to establish a new crop, when severe yield loss is predicted. The present project addresses these crucial points by developing a series of FIspace Specific Enablers (SE) integrated into a Decision Support System that delivers the results of a prognosis model (SE DIP Cereal) alongside with the possibility to enter field observations (SE Monitoring). The model is based on a SE that provides local weather data via an open interface (SE Weather) which will also be made available to third-party FIspace apps. On the other hand, the SE DIP Cereal can be used by any weather data SE that implements the open exchange format.

Respectively, these ways seem to be ineffective, not be readily available (or not available at all) or take longer than needed. OpenPD, an on-the-field and on-the-fly system for fast identification of plant pests and diseases, aims to provide a way to shorten the response time for a correct diagnostic of plant and crop pests and diseases by speeding up the process of identification.

Besides, during harvesting, it is difficult to predict an appropriate time to sell the crops. The demand for different products varies not only among European countries, but even within a particular country. Therefore, planning is an essential problem for future profitability of agricultural activities. Naturally, cultivation may be affected by a number of factors: meteorological, geographical and geological and these factors affect the current prices. The problem, however, are the future prices. Unfortunately, the average farmer is not able to make calculations as to what produce will be paid more in the coming years and how the prices will be shaped. The problem also occurs for produce purchasing companies. They do not know what products are needed and how much they will be able to buy. Therefore, they need opportunities to issue bids. Our application is directed to farmers with small and medium-sized farms who have a problem with estimating future prices of agricultural products and determining which crops at the moment are profitable. Our application is designed to estimate prices of agricultural products and to analyse of the profitability of production of raw materials. Complex statistical activities as well as mathematical and econometric analysis in our application will allow to carry out such assessment.

Member States will use 30% of their national envelope in order to pay for this greening approach. Article 45(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides for the protection of the share of permanent grassland compared to the total agricultural area. Individual reconversions and a prohibition of further conversions should be required in case of a decrease beyond 5%. In order to achieve this goal, Member States should monitor the evolution of the share of permanent grassland. The task of monitoring the evolution of the share of permanent grassland is not so easy and trivial especially for the south European Member States where the morphology and the special features of the permanent grassland are too different compared to the northern countryside. To this context, agricultural producers possessing livestock need to utilize and to declare during its own community aids applications (Pillar 1 applications) such an amount of permanent grassland (i.e., pasture) that excuses the greening payment. PEGAPP deals with the green direct payment in a way that it deploys an ICT product that facilitates the European agricultural producers owning livestock to comply with the greening demands of the new CAP regarding the maintenance of the permanent grassland. Specifically, the PEGAPP ICT product enables the composition of viable pasture management plans.

Logistically it is no possible to weight out each pig with a scale. Is for that reason that the development of a new system aimed to facilitate this task would be very much appreciated in the animal production sector, in particular in the porcine sector. A system like this would improve those pig weighing controls that currently are not viable and even profitable.

The traditional telemetry solutions, designed originally for industry market, have not succeeded for this use case. The causes are the special characteristics of the farm (difficult access to a quality electrical grid, poor or no M2M coverage, bulk solids difficult to measure, etc.) and the limited budget available per silo. Consequently, and despite of his importance, the way the stocks are being controlled is manual and very inefficient. Usually, the farmers have to climb to the silos and make a visual estimation of stocks. This is a dangerous activity that also is not performed as often as it should, causing inefficiencies and disruptions in the business processes: lack of daily consumption information, urgent purchase orders caused by broken stocks, failure to properly plan the feed production, etc. Our solution to the problem is Smart Silo, a READY-TO-USE, HIGHLY-EFFICIENT and LOW-COST platform for remote control of stocks in feed silos in the environment of a farm.

EU farmers have gradually acquired more animals over time so as to be eligible for higher/more subsidies. This has led to big and difficult-to-manage flock sizes, additional fodder costs and pasture degradation. With rising fodder prices in the international market, farmers could afford less fodder but flock sizes were not reduced, inevitably leading to overgrazing and pasture degradation. Consequentially, the quality of pastures has been deteriorating while the animals are malnourished and less productive.

Since Widhoc was created it has focused on its business in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT), creating innovative solutions in the world of agriculture. Specifically, we have designed, implemented and validated several hardware and software architectures for agronomic and oceanographic environments since 2007. Currently, Widhoc team provides a specific technical advice service to farmers and has 15 customers, who have an average of 3 autonomous nodes installed. Due to the variety of case studies, the Widhoc device allows the connection and usage of a wide variety of sensors: water content, temperature, electrical conductivity and matric potential in the soil, temperature and ambient humidity, as well as sensors to monitor the quality and the amount of water in an irrigation reservoir. These nodes form a distributed network, as each node communicates directly and wirelessly via GPRS with the server physically installed at Widhoc central node. Nowadays, Widhoc members are studying the FI-WARE Ecosystem. The final objective of the project AMS (Agricultural Management System) is focused on migrating the actual adhoc implementation in the agronomical sector to the FI-WARE platform by using the advantages that the FI-WARE Data/Context Management components offer.

Innovative technology concepts ask a high level of knowledge for operation of the systems. Farmers often lack the background to fully use the potential of the technology. This creates a shift in knowledge from farmers to technology suppliers. The distance from suppliers to the farms often creates logistic problems. To solve this problem the consortium intends to develop an application with which the stable can be monitored, maintained and settings can be changed. Through sensors in the stable a lot of data is collected, containing animal weight, feed properties, water quality, odor, ammonia, humidity, but also the properties of the manure. All this data is analyzed by the app and the settings of the stable can be automatically adjusted. Next to this automation step, maintenance and steering can be done from any distance. In a control center the stable properties (smell, visuals, humidity, etc.) can be mimicked for input of the operator. The app should provide information for both farmers and suppliers. This makes it possible for technology suppliers to export their products all over the world  nd be able to reach the production levels that are possible with the innovative technology.

The main outcome of the project will be the design and prototyping of PRESS (Pervasive Environment Sensing and Sharing), a novel Internet-enabled cost-effective product sensing air pollution and displaying data in an easy-to-use Web application. In this manner end-user will be able to monitor the quality of air in real-time as well as to view historical information, e.g., considering a given time period in the past.

In particular, end users will be able to deploy the PRESS box wherever they want, considering not only fixed locations such as houses and work-places, but also moving ones such as cars or bags of commuters. In fact, the PRESS box will be battery-enabled allowing also to use it for short-to-medium trips, GPS-equipped to relate sensed information with geographical locations, and small/lightweight to be easily carried-on. 

Moreover, end users will be able not to only to monitor the data sensed by their own PRESS box, but also to get an aggregated view of the data sensed by PRESS boxes of other users in a given geographical area and in a specific time period. In this manner, while each PRESS box will be useful to gather information of the private surrounding of specific users, the aggregated view will boost the knowledge of the quality of air of wider areas.

We strongly believe that the adoption of PRESS will strongly increase the environmental awareness of citizens, providing them with actual information of air pollution in a pervasive manner. In this way, citizens will be able to assess the overall quality of neighborhoods/cities where they live, eventually triggering more environment-friendly habits and pushing them to ask municipalities to undertake stronger actions to improve the quality of their natural environments.

These aspects are mutually dependent and complementary. They will use the power of ubiquitous network infrastructure to connect all parts of a city (things) and to transfer data faster, securely and in real time.

When we consider the IoT and the Smart City, the importance of a broadband network becomes apparent. Things of a city will be connected via wireless sensor network and the collected data will be transferred via Wi-Fi or Internet networks to management systems (sink points). The convergence between pervasive sensing and networking is a major challenge. Today, the wireless sensor networks suffer from many limits such as low bandwidth, limited processing power, poor QoS performance (delay, jitter, etc.), etc.

Our project deals with these issues. It aims to ensure the convergence between sensor and broadband networks.  Our solution provides network boxes as intermediary between sensors and their Cloud service providers. Indeed, our VirtuOR boxes offer an easy access between the central ?sink point? and its applications or data management systems hosted within the Cloud. These boxes help to make ?sink points? more intelligent, performant and deploy them on-demand as Network Function Virtualisation (NFV). The resources (CPU, memory, etc.) needed by these sink nodes may be adjustable to suit data operations (correlation, mining, analyzing, etc.). Another major benefit of our boxes is to bring the service closer to the sensors. For example, if a sensor needs a monitoring service from the Cloud, it can have locally a virtual instance of this service . A single VirtuOR box could support several ?sink point? from different providers at the same time. This can help to make decision faster, more accurate, and without wasting network resources.

We want to enhance every step of the consumer journey, generate demand, create personalized guest experiences and increase bottom line for the hotel & local economy. 
The core of the idea is to leverage technology & service design so as to incentivize & enable resort guests to replace time spent in passive consumption (costly for the hotel) with time spend out of the hotel (i.e. excursions or town visits) or in under-enrolled in-premise activities (i.e. fitness classes). By replacing passive consumption with rich experiences, we will create a triple win model (guests, hotels, local economies); guests create vivid memories, while hotels? operating costs are reduced and local business revenue is increased.
The focal touch-point is the room?s Smart TV set, which acts as the beginning and end-of-day control center and information hub.  By developing cross-platform connected TV apps, the solution can leverage the existing TV sets of the vast majority of hotels. Using the TV app consumer can i) review available options in & out of the hotel, ii) book activities & transportation, iii) review loyalty program?s point status & redeem points, iv) access rich content about the destination?s culture & unique characteristics, v) share and view user generated content with fellow guests.
All-inclusive resorts are the fastest growing segment in the Global Hotel Industry. The key challenge is up-selling, as guests are locked in the pre-determined price points; thus reducing operating costs is important for profitability. Food & beverages is the single biggest cost element, representing on average 38% of total costs.

Existing smart cities solutions capitalize on various aspects that affect the quality of citizens' life, such as transportation, healthcare and safety, in-house living, ecology and energy, entertainment, information etc. However, most of the approaches are city-centred and expect a large initial investment that will transform the city infrastructure in order to provide better services to the citizens. Citizens are considered service consumers and do not contribute to the reformation process.

On the other side, more and more citizens use smart-phones (smart-phone users globally have surpassed the 1.75 billion in 2014), which usually have a data connection and a number of sensors that provide useful data. This creates an opportunity to apply data mining techniques on movement data and recognize people's daily activities without changing their routine. This information can be further exploited in various applications ranging from healthcare (e.g. fitness application) and transportation (e.g. user's driving habits detection) to entertainment (e.g. POIs suggestions).

'Carpe Diem' is a project that builds on existing knowledge and infrastructure in mobile sensor data analytics and recommender systems. Our goal is to develop a platform, where citizens will be able to anonymously share their real life activity information in a transparent way, similar to the way they browse a web site, and receive recommendations that will assist them to improve their quality of life. Recommendations will be based on a crowd-sourcing and collaborative filtering model, but also on information provided in city level.

All they need to do is to attach Ecoisme sensor to their main power line and connect it to Ecoisme cloud. The sensor measures total energy consumption and sends data to Ecoisme cloud-based system. Then the system singles out every device, plugged-it to the electrical grid to show how efficient they are. Based on this information, Ecoisme will recommend customers easy-to-follow advices to save energy. Moreover, for customers with smart meters the company will offer limited functionality of the service even without installing any additional hardware.

To identify home appliances, Ecoisme uses a comprehensive technology, which combines power and spectrum analysis.

We argue that by introducing our approach small business will be able to provide more flexible and personalized customer loyalty programs, which is the most critical problems in existing approaches. Our approach postulates on the idea of customer loyalty through engaging with a business/merchant in a more sustainable way than only with reward points for each purchase. We argue that especially in smart cities there are much more possibilities to engage customers in the local businesses. Indeed, current research about customer psychology indicates that customers like to feel ?important? for a merchant not only because of the purchase but also due to ?influence? on the business through their opinion, social networking, or even (active) lifestyle. It means that an engaged customer should be motivated to identify with the business in different, daily life, situations she/he is involved in.  Using Smart city infrastructure it will be possible to connect this information with the available (open) data relevant for local businesses. Consequently, the customer should be rewarded for all such activities, usually through some kind of discount coupons or reward points.

Slam requires almost no preparation time, and enables teachers to spend more time one-on-one with students and less time orchestrating the class activity. 

Another barrier to peer learning is that virtually all educational content is designed to be consumed by an individual, which enables stronger students to take over all the work, thus leaving weaker students without learning opportunities. Such poor group dynamics make peer learning experiences ineffective and frustrating. 

For effective peer learning, it is important that students maintain ownership over their own progress, while also being interdependent with their peers.

It will collect and present information about the health of buildings in the city in order to both be prepared for seismic events and automatically provide a validation of the status of a building after it.

This will be achieved by:
(a) leveraging the internet of things and installing accelerometers on top of buildings in order to measure the drift of the roof during smaller, frequent earthquakes and compare it to the values expected at design time for the given seismic acceleration. This comparison will allow cities to know in advance if specific buildings or whole areas are in danger in case of a major earthquake or tornado. If the drift is much bigger than the projected one it is an indication of possible misbehaviour of the structure to the seismic forces.

(b) enabling engineers both in the design and permitting domains to quickly evaluate whether a building structural design complies with a set of regulatory, empirical and statistical rules and best practices. This way the user can easily validate the design against common errors, hidden pain points and other issues that might need special attention. The wide adoption of the eurocodes makes this easy to kickstart for the EMEA area and later aim for global coverage. 

The results of both legs of the system will be visualized on false-color maps of the city where high risk areas/buildings will be highlighted. Lastly it can be used post-disaster to quickly evaluate which buildings are dangerous and should be evacuated.

This project aims to develop a cloud-based Beacon management platform in order to get the most out of Beacons technology. This platform will offer contextualized content to mobile device users, quickly and easily defining their behavior. Moreover, it will offer the possibility to share Beacons infrastructure deployed across many customers. This will enable a global Beacons structure, reducing implementation costs, thus favoring its deployment and use. Information on users? behavior may be obtained through the use of Big Data based technologies. Thus, it will be possible to offer services which were not feasible before through public agencies, private companies, agents, etc. Therefore, this platform will provide new services to public agencies, private companies and citizens, which may be deployed and shared thanks to this platform.

The emergence of Beacons (a new class of low-powered, low-cost transmitters that can notify nearby devices of their presence) is an opportunity not only to interact with users of mobile devices based on the context where they are located, but also to allow private sector and municipalities to provide new value services to the citizens by creating a new ecosystem that interconnects infrastructure providers, services providers, municipalities and citizens. It provides a new sharing cost and revenue share model. The ?Beacon Shared Ecosystem? itself is the main advantage over competition as allows deployment and use of Beacons infrastructure massively, offering new services at very low cost, with no specific brand hardware needed, or just
focusing on Beacons services management, like competitors do. The joint use of FIWARE Cloud infrastructure and this solution facilitates the deployment and use of beacons networks, allowing its adoption by many of organizations and citizens. This solution will interconnect all of them to Cloud services, and will boost new services previously unknown in the environment of

As consumers, we increasingly rely on subscription or pay-per-use services. Software vendors have tapped into this trend with Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS applies subscription, freemium, pay-per-use revenue models to give customers the flexibility they demand, using the Cloud. Using SaaS, SMEs can access solutions that only large enterprises could once afford to buy (and sell, in the case of software companies).

The SaaS sector is booming, with a total market expected to top ?17.7 billion in 2015. Almost two-thirds of the revenue are generated in the SaaS enterprise application marketplaces, where many SaaS solutions are sold. All the major web and desktop applications (Salesforce, Photoshop, Word) have been migrated to the cloud  - a process known as SaaSification. However, entering the SaaS market is complex and expensive and thus inhibits the majority of small Software Vendors - approximately 300.000 EU/USA SMEs for a loss of ?7.1 billion a year.

Indeed to deploy their software as a cloudbased SaaS application, software vendors must rewrite the code; select a cloud service provider; integrate their application onto that provider?s platform; set up billing procedures; run tests; and monitor each customer?s installation.

ClouDesire is a game-changing enterprise application marketplace, which allows for the easy and rapid
SaaSification. Software Vendors can now compete with the big players.

With ClouDesire, the ISV only needs to upload a ZIP file with the software source code & select the VM requirements for the application - 2 hours. ClouDesire automatically manages the application deployments, the billing to the customer, the software upgrades, etc. When purchasing an application from the ClouDesire marketplace, the customers select their preferred cloud provider and proceed to order the application - 15 minutes.

Globally, the most widespread transport that is environmentally friendly is the bicycle. It's a simple and economical system, somewhat difficult to implement, but what would happen if we made its use more accessible?

Most of the bikes are equipped with simple security systems, common padlocks. These security systems work with a mechanical system, the key, but what happens if you forget your key?

We know this problem very well. We are located in the Netherlands, the land of bicycles, and there is no better place to understand the problem. Many times when you want to lock your bike it is difficult to find the keys or you may even have left them at home, in any case, what you never leave your mobile phone.

Something as simple as bringing your phone next to the bicycle lock and open it up would speed up and make easier the use of the bike and we could forget about the keys forever.
The lock works only with the residual energy of the phone, so the device itself will not have any kind battery, making it even more environmentally friendly.

This technology applied to security systems is unhackable, so at the same time that the Lock&Go makes the use of bicycles more accessible and easy, it will also help preventing the theft of the bicycles, since 900,000 bicycles are stolen only in the Netherlands every year.

Apart from this, the Lock&GO app will feature a tracking system via GPS that will constantly send data to the cloud using FIWARE technology, once the lock has been opened. This adds a social value to the device: the user can track the route, and share the information with their friends.

The app will also give the user the possibility of sharing their bike, sending the location and permission to unlock it to another phone. ",Tech Provider,X,X,0,X,0,0,,Hardware,Endpoint Security,System Infrastructure Software,Security Software,2,0,0,SME,0,avioconsys.com

In some places it is too dangerous to even get out of the hotel alone, because of intense criminal activity. However, most places are not really more dangerous than one's own home neighbourhood. It is the fear of the unknown that can pin people down, keeping them from enjoying their vacations to the maximum. Things can get even worse when one has a medical condition or is a bit older, in which case even the slightest problem seems impossible to handle. Based on experience from our own families and friends, we have come to the conclusion that often all people need to go out and live a bit more carelessly is a slight nudge and the mere possibility of a helping hand being nearby; the belief that someone will notice and help soon enough if one falls down or is attacked can make all the difference for ""weaker"" or more scared individuals.

Modern social networking can provide the basis of a very comforting solution for such situations, lowering existing barriers and enabling people to go out more, feeling just safe enough. We aim to start by creating a large enough global group of people, who care to help in such cases for various reasons, personal or professional. People living in an island that depends on tourism, for example, would probably like to help tourists feel safer, both because they may be nice, kind people, but also because the safer tourists feel, the more they will go out and the more money they will spend on the island's stores. Large hotels and their staff also care to have their visitors feel as safe as possible, since this will bring higher profit to the hotels' stores and more and more visitors to them in the long run. Smart City technologies and the Internet of Things can offer useful sensors, data, and services that can be exploited via FIWARE by STROLL, location information and geotagging being perfect examples for this.

In Europe there is a big pain regarding finding available parking spaces, especially in cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants. There are more than 100 such cities in Europe.

We took on the challenge of parking automatization, by providing parking lots and garages with sensors that integrate in their current solution, and remove the synchronization problems.Through this more accurate model of reality, we can provide both consumers and businesses with services and optimized processes which are not otherwise possible.

Businesses will be able to optimize their pricing based on real-time models, and consumers will find the parking lot that is right for their needs, where and when they need it.

Shipping parcels is a quite common needing: it can be processed relying on a professional shipping service rather than traveling in person. Both the solutions hide some drawbacks: traveling by car you will increase roads traffic and then air pollution, while professional express services need longer periods. DeliverMe overtakes this issues, binding both solutions benefits. 
Let?s suppose Bob would like to send flowers to Alice, his girlfriend: he will need to just buy the flowers and access DeliverMe platform, offered both as web site and smartphone application. He will find lots of people that, while travelling, can deliver the parcels: by choosing the right courier, say Carl, on the basis of his needings (places, travel schedule, reliability, ?), the sender will contact him to clear every withdraw aspect. Carl will meet Bob, withdraw the parcel and deliver it to Alice, tracking its delivery relevant shifts using the mobile app. Once the parcel is delivered, Carl will receive the fee previously agreed. 
Sharing economy spread over the last years gave chances to apparently similar solutions already developed: DeliverMe differs greatly from them as it applies to Italian market, for multi-courier shipping and for delivery notification. 
Multi-step (and then multi-courier) shipping is a serious challenge: on one side they pose security issues but on the other they allow to greatly increase the chances to have whatever parcel delivered.
On delivery notifications, the system generates a couple of QR-codes (convenient as easily readable from a smartphone), one stitched on the parcel and another one available to the receiver: when the parcel is delivered, the courier can scan both the codes and then unlock the payment previously made by the sender.

In this region, increasing tourism market is still limited to mainstream destinations and circuits due to weak communication, low integration and visibility. An online tool with direct involvement of local stakeholders is an ideal candidate to bridge the gap between an increasing demand of alternative, small-scale tourism and an existing and potential local offer of high quality products, sights and facilities. 
Thanks to our platform, tourist users will input their preferences receiving an answer with a suggested itinerary facilitating booking and organization. Several FIWARE enablers will be involved in developing a bottom-up, horizontal and dynamic system, making possible an effective interaction between tourists and organized local stakeholders.  
Monetization will rely on subscriptions by local stakeholders and additional services, including marketing and communication support, booking services, and online advertising spaces.
It would be the first time in Sicily that small-scale tourism is targeted and supported, creating a network among local SMEs, and, at the same time, offering tourists an economically advantageous experience. Finally, our project will address a market segment not overlapping with other competitors. These competitive advantages are not limited to Sicily: the business model is easily replicable in other regions in Italy and abroad.

CoRe enables consumers to make informed choices by translating and simplifying labels and conveniently allowing them to personalize the app: this way, ?grades? on products are in direct alignment with their own preferences.

City councils and institutions are working hard to obtain the best results by adding ""intelligence"" to their city. The amount of information is increasing with better infrastructure. However, cities present a number of difficulties as this is costly and hard to implement. Furthermore, it's usual that their own citizens feel apart from these efforts.

In this proposal we emphasize the aspect that deals with implementing this kind of technology based solutions in cities by promoting the Internet of Things (IoT) as an enabler and facilitator that allows city assets, entities, and the most important, citizens to be part of a Proactive City.

In this context, the main objective of this proposal is to build a pilot in order to obtain a framework based on FIWARE which leads to a feasible and easy to implement technology for any city, of any type or size, encouraging the participation of citizens.

From our expertise, it's clear that there must be a common standard for connectivity. The cost and the lack of interoperability of vertical solutions from different vendors are enough reasons for making this technology difficult to implement and feasible only for big cities. Our role here is to tackle this by providing an easy to implement framework where anyone is able to add value.

Our innovative concept encompasses elements such as: fully automated business logics, accurate mapping; real-time monitoring of several parameters and personal alerting by exceptions; proactive maintenance; and support to tactical and operational decision-making. The usage of the Bosolog product is very generic and concerns many different sectors. In this application, we have chosen to illustrate the potential of following markets concerning SmartCities: 1. Meal delivery to elderly in nursing- and care home; 2. Transportation of art in state authorized museums 3. Public bus passenger transportation security & comfort and 4. Public disability/elderly driving service security & comfort. We at Bosolog estimate a total market potential of approximately ?6,2 million a year only in Denmark for the four areas, based on data collected from the Danish Transport Authority and Danish Culture Agency. Bosolog will in year 3 have gained a market share of 1 %  with a turnover of ?8,3 million . This is only a small fraction of the total share for Bosolog, due its generic applicability, both describing and monitoring the object in question and its surroundings. It is easy to implement, because there is no need to make any constructional changes for the customers.

The objectives of the idea are:
? To put the producers and waste managers in contact with each other.
? To optimize the cost/profit for the producer and manager.
? To improve the management of removals for the manager.
? To put the information in the catalogue of managers and producers as OpenData.
? The producer will be able to find other producers in his area.
? The producer is enable to provide and promote his by-products.
? The producer is able to know and communicate with other producers of his waste.
? The manager is enabled to consult producers.

It will be a web tool designed to help the producer to obtain improved response times in removals and a lower economic cost, while the waste managers benefit from a tool that carries out the work of grouping removals together automatically.

We will use the innovative FIWARE Cloud platform in order to benefit from its Open Source code and be able to:
? Identify users and have security OAuth2.0. KeyRock
? Manage context date with the information on waste in real-time. ORION- cygnus
? Store historical data. COSMOS
? Design mobile services in order to manage geopositioning, incidents and removals. WireCloud
- CKAN Open Data

Potential users are in the thousands, as this is a service required by almost any SME. 

Also by the additional services that we will gradually incorporate, such as:
- Sending removal data to their specific ERP.
- Local information on producers.
- Publicity.

Using high-end Peltier Cells (thermoelectrical transducers) and the novel power energy converters developed by AEInnova is possible to generate electricity from the waste heat, thermal heat and in general from any hot surface. Moreover, due to the DCSI group large experience in wireless sensor networks, AEInnova can apply any kind of sensors to these waste heat harvesters allowing the possibility of remote real time monitoring of any hot infrastructure. This technology is applied to the AEInnova Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU), a system capable to convert waste heat from any hot surface into electricity. The energy converter allows to interconnect cents of Peltier Cells recovering energy from large hot surfaces like industrial pipes and smokestacks, independently of the temperature gradient of these surfaces.

The technology core are System on Chip circuits parameterized conveniently in order to manage the energy generated by Peltiers, dynamically, and monitor any parameter in real time. To complete the power module, we have designed a DC-DC power converting platform that allows to convert the overall power generated by Peltier to 24VDC / 12VDC voltage.

Also, we are developing a mobile, web and desktop app  in order to report to our customer about the overall performance of the whole system in real time, monitor any critical parameter in order to actuate if needed (preventive maintenance). This is based in the big data FI-WARE technology that we are applying to our designs.

The SolencoPower Box is a decentralized power production and energy storage device, coupled with an open-source Cloud-based Energy Management architecture, able to connect to any type of energy sensor (inter-operability). The device is modular, just like Solar PV and wind are modular. The SolencoPower Box can be installed in one single home - and as the installed base grows, energy data is optimized at house-level, community, city, region...It enables a shift in the energy model from central distribution to local generation and distribution while stabilizing the grid and hence enabling higher penetration (up to 100%) of Solar PV and wind energy. The product enables  households to be 100% independent from the grid and 100% independent from price fluctuations in fossil fuels.

As consumers, we increasingly rely on subscription or pay-per-use services. Software vendors have tapped into this trend with Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS applies subscription, freemium, pay-per-use revenue models to give customers the flexibility they demand, using the Cloud. Using SaaS SMEs can access solutions that only large enterprises could once afford to buy (and sell, in the case of software companies).
The SaaS sector is booming, with revenues forecasted to reach $106B in 2016 (Forrester). Almost 2/3 of the revenue are generated in the SaaS enterprise application marketplaces, where many SaaS solutions are sold. All the major web and desktop applications (Salesforce, Photoshop, Word) have been migrated to the cloud  - a process known as SaaSification. However, entering the SaaS market is complex and expensive and thus inhibits the majority of small Software Vendors - approximately 300.000 EU/USA SMEs for a loss of ?7.1 billion a year.

Indeed to deploy their software as a cloud based SaaS application, software vendors must rewrite the code; select a cloud service provider; integrate their application onto that provider?s platform; set up billing procedures; run tests; and monitor each customer?s installation.
ClouDesire is a game-changing enterprise application marketplace, which allows for the easy and rapid
SaaSification. Software Vendors can now compete with the big players.
With ClouDesire, the ISV only needs to upload a ZIP file with the software source code and select the VM requirements for the application (2 hours). ClouDesire automatically manages the application deployments, the billing to the customer, the software upgrades, etc. When purchasing an application from the ClouDesire marketplace, the customers select their preferred cloud provider and proceed to order the application (15 minutes).
With SaaSi-FI we want to increase the level of flexibility required by the SaaS market. ",Service Provider,0,X,0,0,0,0,,0,0,#N/A,#N/A,4,0,0,SME,0,0

The business idea can be summarized in providing an authentication and high precision positioning EAGLE device to private or public owned vehicles, in order to manage the access to downtown areas, in a more flexible and smart way.
Basically EAGLE introduces the possibility of a ?Fluid Limited Traffic Zone?, in which fixed gates is no longer the standard method to regulate dynamically downtown access.
Instead PA (Public Administration) can manage traffic in a new smarter way, implementing differential access to the city center, based for example to political rally, block based pollution data, urban air quality and commercial activities.
The project aims to build a new standard for city mobility and automotive industry with the implementation of EAGLE as a mandatory device in the future.
EAGLE device can be sold directly to the PA that require it, while the definition and provision of related service will be under the responsibility of the PA, which will be free to choose the most proper way to implement the features and service that EAGLE can offer to regulate the traffic limited zones
In alternative the system can be sold to the PA service provider.
Core element of the system architecture is a cloud based end to end interface which is capable of collecting and managing the consistent amount of data generated by EAGLE and other car sensors.

Drones can reduce 60% of the cost per kg of a parcel delivery, and almost 1/10 of the cost per delivery, comparing with a currier on a electrical scooter. This can reduce the cost for consumers and improve the service level when delivering parcels to hard to reach regions, or by using it as a competitive or strategic advantage. The main customers for this product are logistic operators, who want to offer a wide range of transport modals, and postal service companies, who effort to reduce the delivery cost to its compulsory service.

For this to be possible, the drone should be able to fly beyond line of sight, so it has to fly autonomously, capable of avoid obstacles and it should be aware of other vehicles in the same air space, thus it must be connected with an Air Traffic Controller to authorise flight and manage the airspace according to the regulation permits.

For a logistic operation, there are many fundamental steps required to ensure and organize the process. It include a control panel for delivery setup, notification from receiver accepting the landing, notification for operation that the cargo is ready, and notification of drone readiness. All of this system should be in a cloud server and adopt secure and reliable standards of communication. Here is where FIWARE plays an essential role to integrate the whole solution.

The company is seeking investment and partnerships to perform pilots and complete a commercial prototype.

The scooter will be light and bi-foldable,in the sense that it can be turned into a trolley to carry bags and also folded for an  easy transportation on any kind of public or private vehicles. 

The GREENBOARD is not a ?normal? electric scooter but it is an electric-computer assisted kick scooter able to support the user during commutes also through an innovative set of services that use a smartphone to connect the physical device to the Internet.

The board will have several sensors embedded (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) that will be able to collect data continuously and store them locally and into the cloud through the smartphone of the user. Such data will be analyzed and integrated with data coming from several other sources (typically open) such as real-time schedules of the public transportations, traffic, weather, location of friends, etc. On the bases of these integrated data a completely new class of kind of services will be developed and deployed to the user of the GREENBOARD.

The project includes:
?	the development of the mechanical, electric and electronic part of the City GREENBOARD
?	the creation of a cloud-based infrastructure to collect data supporting the customer in using the City GREENBOARD; these data include:
-	profiles of use of the GREENBOARD and preferences of the customer

Currently, municipalities can?t address and manage the demands of their citizens in real time, and often the information about these requests is invalid or incomplete, making the process impossible. Classic solutions based on phone calls, paper forms and local newsletters are inefficient due to data duplication and disorganization.
We provide a platform that allows citizens and service providers to communicate with their governments with:
- Backoffice web for councils and service providers, providing automatic organization and redundancy management.
- A mobile app and webapp for citizens: create new requests, get feedback about the city
- Technician app to complete the feedback circuit.
 
Thanks to our platform citizens can collaborate to improve their cities through simple actions and governors can be more effective as they can measure what their cities are demanding and can validate the Service Level Agreement of theirs service companies.
 
Our target customer are city councils dealing energy saving, sustainable mobility and eGovernment. They have difficulties in the process of relationship with service providers and citizens, having the perception that the process is untransparent, expensive and inefficient.

In the last few years major European countries, among which (though in a second phase) Italy, have seen the introduction of new players in the urban transportation services market: carsharing, bikesharing and scootersharing. Together with the excitement these innovative services have generated, some of the most important effects are, for example, the decrease in CO2 emissions, traffic and parking optimization, etc. On the other hand, while big cities like Milan are seeing the birth of new services by the day, there is a lack of a centralized coordinated tool that could help citizens to fully benefit from the synergies that could be created among service users. 

eVeryride is a multiplatform application for iOS, Android and Windows Mobile; it permits users to check all available sharing mode vehicles in a city of interest and to directly book them. Users are able to quickly compare all available alternatives and make the best choice among available options. The application is also provided with a lot of different additional services such as pop up notifications that tell the user when the first available car parks in an area of interest, or cost and time to destination estimation. At the same time, eVeryride also offers the opportunity of booking a taxi directly from the application.

With TheCityGame, it is the first time that gamification, social networking, and real-time ?reporting of good? have been brought together to create a unique platform for millions across the globe to socialize, have fun and at the same time act responsibly in respect to the environment and society. In very few words ta typical use case is the following: The user opens the application, sees which good actions they can perform by browsing through them or by seeing other users? performed actions, learn about the importance and the impact of an action, perform the action and verify by taking a picture, earn points which serve as a social indicator of ?how good you are?, challenge other friends to do the same, and finally redeem these points for gifts.

On the business side, it helps cities and organizations to achieve civic engagement, CSR and fundraising goals, by offering a platform for cities to communicate with citizens, and sponsored missions (knorr sponsors the mission around cooking with the lid on to save energy) or for one-click donations (the mission is to donate to a charitable organization).

The bigger problem for the taxi industry as a whole is the lack of incentives for them to improve quality of service (individually they are not rewarded by its perceived quality), resulting in a global loss of demand.

The bigger pains for taxi passengers are:
- the uncertainty about quality of service
- the payment process
- the need to use different platforms on different geographies

- passenger mobile & web apps;
- passenger phone service to be managed by 3rd party operators (eg traditional dispatch cooperatives)
- open API for any demand generator (eg multimodal transportation app) be integrated with TAXIMOTIONS solution.
- driver mobile app

TAXIMOTIONS was designed to work with different dispatch services, but also with each individual taxi. From the demand side, it works everywhere.

Traditional phone dispatch cooperatives and other demand generators have their own branded passenger apps, that work exclusively with their fleet in the cities they are present. In other cities, the proprietary app is connected with the entire TAXIMOTIONS fleet.
