This agro-ecological approach, following the European 676 / EEC Directive 91 /, has the following objectives: ? Reduce and control pollution of water ? Improve yield and protein content of cultures ? Evaluating real-time flow of nitrates in the soil-plant transfer zone (rhysosphere) To achieve these goals, ATS-ECLO1 focus on two major issues: ? Bring the appropriate dose at the right moment for the plant growth ? Optimize the establishment of the next crop or intermediate crop trap nitrate The technical solution consist in a network of underground sensors and associated web applications based on FIWare technologies. This is used to assess in situ and continuous cropping potential of agricultural soil by an automated method of monitoring the flow of nitrates. Impacts : \u2022 Decrease water pollution by nitrates \u2022 Improve yield and protein content of crops by monitoring \u2022 Optimize the economic performance of farms by reducing the cost of treatment \u2022 Integrate and benchmark data at the regional level for cooperatives and institutions The final module will be connected to web and mobile apps and API and facilitate the crop fertilization for farmers. Indeed, European cereal producers farmers and vegetable crops as well as agricultural cooperatives and food processing industries could benefit from this new system to optimize nitrogen inputs on the soil.

Each second, the world\u2019s population grows by nearly 3 more people, that is 240,000 people a day. By 2025, the global population will reach 8 billion people and 9.6 billion by 2050. This means there will be an extra billion mouths to feed within the next 12 years. And within one generation, there will be more people additionally on the planet than there were at the beginning of the 20th century. Feeding the growing world population poses an unprecedented challenge to human ingenuity. Even in the best of circumstances, sustainably satisfying this hugely increased demand for crops and livestock will be an enormous task. By 2050, food production must increase by 70% to keep pace. European Agriculture needs to become more productive and at the same time to meet environmental goals. Reconciling food production and environmental goals can be achieved through the adoption of appropriate technologies. Frequently farm entrepreneurs do not have the right information at the right time in order to manage efficiently both their farm production and the phytosanitary (pesticide and fertilizers) treatments needed for the health plants. Moreover very often the information related to sow /harvest /treatments are not interconnected with the pesticide and fertilizers storage and are used only for administrative scopes. Agricolous project aim at address these problems by providing a novel solution integrated into FI-WAARE/ FI-SPACE technology enabling farmer to both produce \u201cmore with less\u201d improving and reduce agriculture\u2019s environmental footprint.

The connected city can be a promising solution., Kiunsys wants to offer the first connected mobility platform overcoming the fragmentation of the existing silos systems, hardware and software, for urban mobility services, and supporting the integration of multiple applications, to deliver integrated, more effective and higher quality services. Our core platform, INES Cloud, is already able to connect to many urban road infrastructures (i.e. parking sensors, LTZ gates, VMS, etc.) managing a huge amount of data and processes, however it still needs to enhance some key aspects for reaching its goal: embracing open standards for interfacing more third party systems so opening the product to future technological evolutions towards the IoT and Big Data., Thus our objective is to exploit some of the FI-WARE GEs to add new key features and services to INES Cloud, to become the one stop solution for managing all the operations related to mobility, parking and city logistics in cities of any size., The idea is to greatly improve INES Cloud along two directions:, 1) To evaluate and later integrate one or more of the 4 Backend Device Management GEs (NEC IoT Broker Configuration Manager, Orion Context Broker, Backend Device Management \u2013 IDAS, Configuration Manager - IoT Discovery). This will enhance the INES connection with the IoT world in a more radical way, by supporting more standardized and easier interfaces to on field urban devices (sensor, actuators and related gateways) for devices management, acquisition of data streaming, data elaboration and actions triggering; , 2) To integrate PROTON CEP GE (Complex Event Processing). This will greatly enhance the INES capability of processing the increasing amount of urban mobility operations and services by enabling the platform to tackling real time, more complex event driven, action-reaction mechanisms.

Realizing how much time, money and quality of life we were missing out for that purpose we really wondered: Why is it so hard to eat healthy? We learned that it is not like people do not have the will or persistence to eat well; rather everyone wants to look and live well. The problem is that only a few really know how to do it, do not have the time to do it or both. This gave birth to GAIA NutritionÃ¢\u20acâ¢s idea to make real success in Fitness achievable without literally being on a treadmill for hours and not getting anywhere., So, what do we do? In brief: We maximize results by increasing productivity. Our customers will get more done in the same time with better, long lasting effects. To achieve this, we created a 360ÃÂ°, full nutrition management service that comes with targeted, science approved nutrition protocols, woven for our customerÃ¢\u20acâ¢s individual goals. Additionally, because we know, that a protocol alone is not enough, we will form an online service that reminds them of their personal goals, keeps track of their progress and challenges them step by step, to reach the next level. Furthermore we will take care of all the grocery shopping, delivering all the ingredients for their tailored diet right to their door Ã¢\u20ac\u201c without any extra fees! To make this all possible our goal is to cooperate with established grocery stores like REWE so our customer can take advantage of their superior quality and logistics capabili ties., All in all we strip away the efforts of a healthy diet, like researching, creating meal plans and grocery lists, even goingshopping, leaving our customers with all the more time for sports and the other good things in life!

On the other hand a few countries have started a fundamental energy revolution. In Germany the energy transition decided by politics and agreed in consensus is called \u201cEnergiewende\u201d and can be defined by three operating figures: 50 \u2013 80 \u2013 90. This means, we have to consume 50% less energy until the year 2050. 80% of power and thermal are fed by renewable energy sources and will be buffered and transferred by smart grids, no nuclear energy is used any more. As a consequence there is a 90% reduction of greenhouse gas production [1]. Electromobility powered by renewable energy plays an important role and is a core element of Smart Cities, the Energiewende and of the sustainable mobility of the future \u2013 in urban and rural areas., This includes a technical as well as a social dimension; the whole transformation towards a cleaner, more quiet and therefore a more sustainable mobility system needs the acceptance of society, followed by a major change in its attitude and behaviour., But there is one issue to be overcome: electromobility is a black box to the citizens. In practice, who knows the differences between electric bikes regarding speed, vehicle insurance, helmet regulations and driving license? Or, whether battery-electric cars or hybrid-cars better fulfil individuals\u2019 daily use requirements with reference to operating distances and the availability of charging stations? Or the fact that roundabout two-thirds of the public transport running on rails is already electrified? Up to now it is a subject de facto reserved for experts, technical engineers and human beings who are cutting-edge early-adaptors., To close the gap, we \u2013 electromobility experts and socio-economic researchers \u2013 have created a tool called \u201cElektr-O-Mat\u201d to match (electro-)mobility with citizen needs and explore the relationship between both., In order to participate the broad public in the mobility transition, the tool was developed as part of the R&D-project \u201cOnline Schaufenster ElektromobiltÃ¤t\u201d. The project, funded by the \u201cMinisterium fÃ¼r Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\u201d, is realized by a project consortium consisting of Fraunhofer IAO, YellowMap AG and \u201ce-mobil BW \u2013 Landesagentur fÃ¼r ElektromobilitÃ¤t und Brennstoffzellentechnologie Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg GmbH\u201d, and is part of the overall regional programme \u201cLivingLab BWe mobil\u201d with nearly 40 projects and 100 partners from economy, science and civil society [2]., The Elektr-O-Mat is a participation game. In the next chapters the objectives and research questions are stated (chap. 2), the methodological approach behind the game is outlined (chap. 3) and the game itself and its mechanisms are explained (chap. 4). On this basis, empirical findings generated by the game are presented (chap. 5) and participation games are compared with classical surveys (chap. 6).

Walking to the next closest stop of the same line if time allows, leaving the vehicle one or two stops before arrival, or walking during stopover times to a further away stop to catch the connecting line, combined with nice walking routes when possible, will allow them to reach the minimum daily activity recommended by WHO in a pleasant and effortless way.

Therefore, farmers and advisors need context-related information to support their long-term and short-term planning. They need to be able to acquire this knowledge without access restrictions to scientific publications. The problem is that all this information is currently dispersed at different online and off-line locations/media, making access to the already acquired knowledge difficult. Collecting the necessary context-related information is therefore currently a challenging task. To this end, we propose implementation of Organic-AgriWare that will combine organic agricultural research knowledge with other available practical information, maximizing the practical benefits for organic agriculture stakeholders. This will be a mobile platform that will provide a mashup with unique and context-aware access to the Organic Eprints resources and information from both relevant FIspace apps and other useful resources for the users, determined after a relevant use-case study. Organic-AgriWare\u2019s implementation is based on a strategic partnership spanning two European countries, Denmark and Greece, between Agro-Know, ICROFS, and DAAS. The end application could be used by anyone interested in organic agriculture. However, the targeted customer segments are agricultural advisors and organic farmers. It will operate under a freemium revenue model, it will capitalize on already existing and future collaborations with other FIspace application providers, and it is expected to have a high early adoption rate. Our lean manufacturing and agile development approach mandates the addition of a fourth milestone.

It will consist of digital games, books, educational material, animations, stuffed animals and other merchandise., , Â , , Rounders are animal characters with round figures. The characters are easily approachable. They each have their own unique personality traits.The adventures of the Rounders are fun and entertaining for children of all ages. In the heart of the stories you can always find a lesson of socio-emotional skills.Rounders live in Sunny Cloud. It is a magical place where anything can and will happen.Â , , Â , , Rounders game is an educational and entertaining game for young children, teaching emotional intelligence. The game is for both solo play and social activity. The game connects the physical world and the virtual world by using geotagged Open Data streams. The introduction of real-world places and phenomena will bring the experience closer to real life and enhance the transfer of learned emotional skills to everyday life. By matching players by physical proximity has also the potential to connect children with real-life social groups., , Â , , The Rounders game is an online multiplayer game for children aged 4 to 10. But instead of fighting wars or battling in dungeons, children will share emotions and learn how to cope better with negative emotions like anger or jealousy. Sharing emotions with Rounders characters and other players the child will learn positive solutions for everyday situations e.g. how to get over temper tantrums., , Â , , For example Cranky Crabbie has had a really difficult morning and you can help him by giving him emoticons of your choosing. E.g. if you give him hugs, it is easier for him to wake up. And if you add a few cheers emoticons you can see how Cranky Crappie\u2019s day will turn into a happy one. But if you give him a hissy fit, his day will turn into a cranky one., , Â , , All players will see what emoticons other players have given to the characters. The amount of emoticons will influence in witch path the character will go. Children will learn how their emotions and choices affect them., , Â , , Children can create their own 3D characters with simple tools. (In the future, perhaps you can print your own character with a 3D printer.) With geolocation we bring players in physical proximity into the same environment in-game. E.g. Rounders can organize a dance competition or a pop concert in the physical world, and while attending the event, all players will share the same space inside the Rounders game., , Â , , Game platform uses Open Data sources to enrich Rounders environment. E.g. Helsinki city has an Open Data source for landscaping information that provides detailed data about parks, forests, and the common environment. When the player is in Helsinki, the Rounders environment will mirror their physical location - if they are in park physically, their character in the game is inside a park (or forest). The game will eventually have APIs for 3rd party developers to connect external data sources to the game.Â , , Â  "},{"id_internal":"42b79571-b60e-4842-a3c5-92f4796b5cab","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"SOUL-FI","Q1_2":"Italy","Q1_3":"Giuseppina Carai ","Q1_4":"SlowTelling Travel (STT) ","Q1_6a":"B","Q1_6b":"A","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"5.00","Q1_8":"3.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Virtual Characters,Self-Service Interfaces,POI Data Provider ,Backend Device Management,Application Mashup,Gateway Data Handling GE ","Q1_13":"10000.00","Q1_16":"1.00","Q2_1":"TRL3","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"30.00","Q3_2b":"10.00","Q3_2c":"60.00","Q3_4":"D,A","Q3_5":"C","Q3_6":"2015","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"A","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"A","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"5.00","Q4_3b":"25.00","Q4_3c":"80.00","Q4_3d":"130.00","Q4_4":"A","Q4_5":"A","Q4_6":"50.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEFENCE; COMPULSORY SOCIAL SECURITY","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech Provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"X","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Services Operations Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Operations and Manufacturing Applications","SME_STARTUP":"Web-entrepren","full_text":"SIowTelling travel is a web platform and an app, which promote small cities and local communities development through a digital and smart storytelling process, according to the internet principles of crowdsourcing and real time information.

The problem affects primarily private citizens (bike-commuters and urban cyclists) and bike sharing services., Bicycle theft causes serious inconvenience for citizens and commuters who suddenly find themselves without their means of transportation. The fear of theft is a deterrent that limits a wider adoption of bicycles in cities and the victims of theft are more likely to spend less on the replacement bicycle, choosing something cheaper, less secure, and sometimes even turning to the black market (FIAB, 2013)., The Total Available Market was estimated starting from data on urban mobility of the European Commission. The 29% of Europeans cycle at least once a week, that is about 147 million cyclists, leading to a \u20ac18,4 billion TAM., The identified Serviceable Available Market includes cyclists who also live in European Countries where the average price of a new bicycle is higher than \u20ac300 and who spent more than \u20ac900 for their bicycle. This funnelling process leads to about 20 million prospective customers and to a SAM of \u20ac2,4 billion (13% of TAM). see before When common locks and chains fail at preventing bicycle theft, there is almost no chance to retrieve the bicycle. Sherlock is a GPS-based anti-theft device connected to a smartphone app that allows cyclists to precisely locate their bicycles and retrieve them in case of theft. Sherlock is embedded into the structure of the bicycle and it is characterized by an unobtrusive design, providing a flawless user experience. Sherlock aims to become the main device to help spreading the IoT in the context of smart mobility.

At present, the world of amateur sport and competitions is not digitalised and it is not possible to see non-professional results from games held in neighbourhoods even though these events do have a very important social impact because sons and daughters, siblings, family members and friends are taking part and being followed and supported. A lack of players is also quite frequent as is the fact of not knowing where one can go to take part in a sporting event.  WSSN will create an important social network thanks to this nucleolus and it will allow members to interrelate with each other in order to create and design championships, teams and develop local trade by making it possible for them to offer their products and services connecting supply and demand in real time and through geo-location, therefore making smartmobility easier in smartcities.

Dental care products and services do not only improve people\u2019s appearance, but also contribute to have healthier habits. One of the most popular dental products is the orthodontics, since it has a direct visible impact in people\u2019s appearance., , Orthodontics is used to align the teeth and improve i) the smile, ii) eating and biting experiences (occlusion) and iii) self-confidence., However, wearing orthodontics is low aesthetic; it causes rejection between adolescents but also provokes reactions between grown-up people, who also feel ashamed of wearing metallic brackets in their teeth. In addition, orthodontics is expensive because it is a specific product manually manufactured and tuned for each person. The previous reasons provoke rejection to orthodontics, even if it improves health (occlusion improvement, pain reduction or elimination of headaches produced by malocclusion, among others)., , The 3DENT project proposes a complete service to incorporate the use of 3D printing and 3D scanning in dental clinics to create removable and transparent orthodontics to align the teeth and provide the end user a satisfying experience. In 3DENT the automation from the scanning to the printed product by using a user friendly Internet web service based on FIWARE and FITMAN is to be developed. A mobile App for iOS and Android, also created with FIWARE technologies, will provide the patient product information and monitoring of the whole treatment, including the 3D graphical follow up of the alignment evolution, the status of the orthodontics (solicited, printed, shipped), the agenda to control the appointment with the dentist, as well as the whole history of the treatment.

SAMGO could be described as an online copy shop where users can scan and print 3D copies of almost every object., To generate a 3D model of the object, different sensor systems will be supported for acquiring the necessary data. The SAMGO web platform is aiming for easy to use sensors like digital cameras, smart phones and gaming console sensors, which potential clients may already have at home. Uploaded data are automatically processed and converted into 3D models while the web platform offers several tools for optimizing these models for 3D printing. SAMGO also provides a 3D printing service, which enables customers to directly order a 3D printed version of their created model., Realizing SAMGO, several FIWARE Generic Enablers (GE) and Specific Enablers (SE) will be utilized. In particular the 3DScan SE, provided by FITMAN, will be used for 3D visualisation of point clouds and meshes. Furthermore, the SAMGO platform will benefit from 3D file storage management tools which are included in the 3DScan SE. SAMGO will also provide user authentication using the Identity Management \u2013 KeyRock (GE). Processing the large amounts of data, the SAMGO back-end will profit from the BigData Analysis \u2013 Cosmos (GE). In order to handle the connection of different sensor types, the Backend Device Management \u2013 IDAS (GE) will be favourable. The FIWARE Store \u2013 WStore (GE) is suitable to implement the SAMGO web shop., The major innovations of the SAMGO web platform are found in covering the entire process from data acquisition to 3D printing in a unified web portal. In particular, providing a common interface for different low-cost sensor devices and the development of innovative algorithms for data processing and model optimization are expected to lead to a significant impact on the consumer market.

The new players in this field are the creative minds (industrial designers, architects, graphic designers, artists etc.) who are open to learn and take advantage of a new process of fabrication. Only those professionals who have a full understanding of digital software tools are able to express their potential and to be competitive, bringing innovative products to market in a smart and cost efficient way. Nowadays the creativity of many people remains hidden and unexpressed because of the steep learning curve in mastering 3D modeling applications, only few can cover this gap and access additive manufacturing hardware technology., , The aim of this project is to reduce the gap existing between digital and physical fabrication process through the implementation of a user friendly 3D data navigation and manipulation protocol. There are 3 tools playing a key role in the digital craftsman\u2019s laboratory: 3D modeling software packages and 3D printing/scanning hardware. The integration of these technologies requires skills and know-how., , Our business idea consists of a web-based platform which will enable 3D modelers to connect with creative minds in order to translate their ideas into physical models and thereby empowering a business relationship. The process of taking a design concept from its original sketch to its final shape requires a lengthy workflow of exchanging information and data between the designer and the 3D modeler. The physical distance between the two makes communication not only time consuming, but also costly. At present, the exchange of information is mostly carried out by verbal communication, email attachments and with personal meetings. The main limitation of this process lies in the difficulty of not being able to display, modify, render and discuss actions and issues related to the model in real-time., , Therefore we are proposing a cost-effective way of designing and co-creating digital models, in a synchronized way, within a shared digital workspace which is not bound to the software used by the modeler and is independent from the physical location of the involved partners and of the production facilities., , The platform will on one side offer software applications to its subscribers, on the other intermediate between the 3D scanning/printing service providers. Our community members will benefit from this all-in-one offer as they will deliver a complete service to their customers., , The software package we intend to use and that will be at the core of our web-based services is FIWARE, this can be further developed and potentially re-sold as a new API, transferrable to different business sectors., , We forecast the usage of this service principally, but not only, by two categories of users: 3D printing enthusiasts who approach this technology for the first time and need full support for taking their design idea to production and designers who know the technology but do not know how to properly use the software tool best suited for their project. On the other hand we hypothesize that there will be two types of platform experts who will offer their competences as a service: technical 3D modelers who will make models following the client\u2019s specification and 3D modelers who will also offer their personal design style for improving aesthetically, functionally or ergonomically the outlook of the product. Each modeler registered on the platform will have a dedicated profile showing products, projects and ratings received by her/his clients.

This issue causes a number of behavioural effects on humans such as concentration, communication disturbance and sleep disruption with direct consequences on effective performance on the work. Acoustic maps represent an essential element of acoustic expertise and acoustic studies, that involve: planning of residential areas, spatial development plans, rational management of emissions, identification of noise sources responsible for exceeding noise limit values in the area, etc.. The emerging IoT, supported by the concept of Smart Cities, can be utilized effectively for managing urban environments since it offers ubiquitous sensing and actuation. The sound sensors network is a mean of delivering in real time specific sound features capable of determining exactly the occurrence of sound events location for security and surveillance purposes or just giving tools and mechanisms for control the road traffic in order to maintain the maximum noise allowed in urban areas. This can be done by adjusting the speed limits of the vehicles in specific streets and avenues. The traditional WSNs offer the advantage of obtaining uninterrupted data but requires new infrastructure to be installed. The project FI-sonic consists of developing the necessary low-cost technology to capture sound, using both pressure microphones and accelerometers devices, to integrate existing frameworks in city environments. The project also includes processing this information with intelligent audio analytics, useful to create dynamic real-time noise maps and identify and localize a set of different sound events. Localizing sound sources is of vital importance, and applications range from localizing sniper fire in urban scenarios and people in distress. All this information is used to create real-time dynamic noise and event maps to be available for the populations.

Named \u201cSpero\u201d, these products are based on the paradigms of the IoE, cloud computing, collaborative systems and empowerment, paradigms that mark a shift to a new era of opportunity for consumers, businesses and governments. The product's basic functionality allows citizens and company clients or employees, who are daily in touch with the urban facilities/networks, by means of a mobile device to report georreferenced occurrences (anomalies, problems) which call for repairs or intervention. The system may be setup to interact with social networks and, through them, allow reports to be followed, commented and cross-checked (data will be used within an innovative approach for decision support analysis taking into consideration social aspects). Spero includes a professional backoffice that receives, organizes and analyses the incoming occurrences with scientific decision support tools. The tools inspect the relevance of the occurrences and rank/classify them, emitting (at request) automatic alerts for urgent cases and periodic reports. All this helps in designing optimized intervention plans. Incorporation of these tools is one of the more innovative aspects of Spero and adds to its value proposition. The system architecture is very flexible and continuously adapts to the specificities of each city or organization. Cloud usage permits virtually unlimited scalability of Spero and its application at a global scale. Spero has two components: (1) reporting and monitoring, which is open for all the public to participate, may include input from the IoT and open data, and (2) the backoffice, which is for professional use by organisations, to be comercialised on a license basis with the option of additional customized versions. Due to (1) municipalities and regional authorities are the natural customer for this sort of service and (2) the social importance of the product. Any company that operates and/or is responsible for urban space can use the system and profit from it. As above: it is the natural market for this service. Any citizen can report an issue in urban space and the system will automatically catalog and forward it to the competent entity.

The connected city can be a promising solution., Kiunsys wants to offer the first connected mobility platform overcoming the fragmentation of the existing silos systems, hardware and software, for urban mobility services, and supporting the integration of multiple applications, to deliver integrated, more effective and higher quality services. Our core platform, INES Cloud, is already able to connect to many urban road infrastructures (i.e. parking sensors, LTZ gates, VMS, etc.) managing a huge amount of data and processes, however it still needs to enhance some key aspects for reaching its goal: embracing open standards for interfacing more third party systems so opening the product to future technological evolutions towards the IoT and Big Data., Thus our objective is to exploit some of the FI-WARE GEs to add new key features and services to INES Cloud, to become the one stop solution for managing all the operations related to mobility, parking and city logistics in cities of any size., The idea is to greatly improve INES Cloud along two directions:, 1) To evaluate and later integrate one or more of the 4 Backend Device Management GEs (NEC IoT Broker Configuration Manager, Orion Context Broker, Backend Device Management \u2013 IDAS, Configuration Manager - IoT Discovery). This will enhance the INES connection with the IoT world in a more radical way, by supporting more standardized and easier interfaces to on field urban devices (sensor, actuators and related gateways) for devices management, acquisition of data streaming, data elaboration and actions triggering; , 2) To integrate PROTON CEP GE (Complex Event Processing). This will greatly enhance the INES capability of processing the increasing amount of urban mobility operations and services by enabling the platform to tackling real time, more complex event driven, action-reaction mechanisms.

However, intensification is confronted with grassland degradation (overgrazing) and with the reduction of grass, meat and milk production due to drought and heat waves. Furthermore, intensification is threatened as there is less herdsman and many of them are lacking traditional pasture management knowledge or having hard time to intensify their extensive farms. On the other hand there are many potential new sources of scientific data and new information-technology-communication tools (ITC) which are unutilized so far in the livestock systems. There are sensors available to track the movement of animals (GPS, telemetry), follow their health condition (temperature, bio acoustic) or to geo-localize them through GIS based maps. Furthermore, collecting local and regional weather data became easier and cheaper than ever before. Remote sensed multispectral images (satellite, drone images) or field based photos (animal camera) could be available to investigate grassland productivity. Herd management data (livestock unit number LSU, feed requirements, health stage etc.) are usually stored in book entries in which modification are difficult to make. Farmers have a huge responsibility above their animals and their product. To ensure milk or meat quality and to sustain grassland productivity farmers needs to consider many aspects at the same time (such as grassland productivity, herd size, animal health, weather and soil condition etc) even if they are lacking of knowledge in certain areas.

This will have multiple effects:, - healthier and happier residents;, - fewer traffic accidents;, - reduced CO2 emissions and pollutants;, - increase the residents knowledge and attention of the neighbourhood;, - boosting local property values and economics., Qirate is an app that maps, rates and gives routing suggestions about the pedestrian-bikers-friendliness of streets and places in urban areas. It is not a simple navigator that takes you from A to B, calculating the shortest distance, but is a powerful and disruptive tool that will change the way of calculating routes. To do so it will combine structural information about the streets (like type of streets, presence of pavements or cycle lanes, crosslights, speed limits and so on) with Environmental indexes (Air quality, Noise levels, Pollens etc) and presence of Points of interest (shops, parks, facilities) and other crowdsourced data., The core engine will measure the friendliness of the route, either applying a standardized combination of parameters or calculating your own by selecting what matters for you the most., Qirate is also offering an API to boost and enhance external websites and applications, so to help perform routing and rating.

Citizens are getting older and live longer in their own homes. Among these elderly the ability to be physically active and have social interactions is an increasing problem. We propose an online platform where  older citizens can engage in a game that stimulates physical activity by interacting with their surroundings and neighbors. With an online platform participants are challenged to walk different routes to city waste containers based on their location of residence. While bringing out the trash, they leave virtual waste along these routes. Other participants, who are also actively involved in the game, can make increasingly challenging city walks to clean their local city map. Every week the duration of the city routes will be increased in order to promote a physically active lifestyle. The online platform brings older people together and enhances social interactions in the offline world for a WasteWalk in the city.

By using crowdsourcing method, Gigdiving removes the risk factor from the live performance industry and empowers fans throughout the process. Gigdiving will not only be a ticket-presale platform, but will also serve as an innovative music fan club for and by music aficionados. It creates a social and engaging experience for music fans to interact and share insights and ideas, while helping their favourite artists\u2019 realize a tour. , , On Gigdiving, fans can pledge to buy tickets to see their favourite artist in their city of choice. When a fan pledges to buy a ticket, this means that he/she is genuinely interested in seeing the artist and will show up at the gig. This will provide the artists and promoters with valuable real time information about where to go and how many people will come. It also means artists get guaranteed funding before the tour., , Product/service introduction:, If an artist with a GigDiving profile has opened a campaign, Fans may offer to purchase a number of tickets for this performance at a ticket price set by you (\u201cPledging\u201d). , After the artist sets the ticket price your pledged tickets will be automatically purchased if:, - Fan's set ticket price is higher than the ticket price set by the artist, fan will pay the ticket price as set by the artist;, - Fan's set ticket price is equal to the ticket price set by the artist;, - Fan's set ticket price is higher than the ticket price set by the artist, but fan has chosen to be a \u201cSuperfan\u201d: you will pay the higher ticket price., , The pledged tickets will not be purchased automatically if your set ticket price is lower than the ticket price set by the artist., , GigDiving is taking a fan-driven approach to the music and concert industry. It also gives artists the flexibility and freedom to manage their own tour. This approach puts all the power in the hands of artists and their fans, keeping the Indie music industry truly independent. With the help of sharing/on-demand services like AirBnB, CouchSurfing and Uber, travel costs are kept to a minimum and tour arrangement will be hassle-free. And through established, professional services and tools like ReverbNation, musicians can find promoters and venues for themselves. , , GigDiving gives musicians and their fans the opportunity to use whichever technology is available to truly stay independent and still travel to perform.

It has a substantial influence on crop growth and yield development, incidence of pests and diseases and irrigation requirements. Weather forecast can significantly support the decisions made on optimization of agro-management practices, such as fertilizer applications and cultural field operations. The Balkan area/South-eastern Europe has an intensive agricultural production and plays an important role as well in European agricultural space. Agricultural sector is big water user in many countries in the area and proper irrigation scheduling (applying of water when needed in the optimal amount) is necessary. Optimization of irrigation water use is based on the fact that sensitivity of crop growth and development may vary between different stages of crop growth. We propose two applications with associated smartphone application (or at least web page adjusted to smartphone): Weather forecast for agriculture application and Irrigation advice application. As we already explained good weather forecasts are extremely important in agriculture, thus we propose application for high resolution weather forecast with the lead time of 3-4 days, which will provide crucial agro-meteorological variables used in agriculture on hourly basis and especially focus on the rain. The spatial extent covers broader Balkan region. Moreover, data from this application could be used also used as an input for other application (e.g. irrigation). Irrigation advice application is a simple application for advising on irrigation timing and amount of water applied for major crops, based on farmers\u2019 tensiometer/lizimeter measurement and rain forecast from Weather forecast for agriculture application. The application will be structured in a simplified manner, offering a farmer a real-time information on the amount of water needs for irrigation.

With the reduction of public funding, they are challenged to behave like companies. To remain sustainable, they now need to monitor performance and boost attendance. Like other businesses, they need more reliable KPIs and extensive audience data (demographics, recurrence, motivation, satisfaction)., , Â , , Market, , Â , , There are 18.886 museums in Europe. 43% of museums offer a mobile experience and 23% plan to offer it in the next year. The average expenditure in digital tools is 30.000 \u20ac/year., , Â , , The most popular goal of mobile projects is visitors\u2019 engagement, followed by providing additional content (2) and interactive experience (3). The least popular goal is revenue., , Â , , Problem, , Â , , Challenges museums face to deliver a mobile experience:, , Acquire mobile users,  Create content and keep it updated,  Technical maintenance,  Evaluate ROI, Â , , Museums are frustrated with the low ROI of mobile projects. They are open to try innovative solutions., , Â , , Solution, , Â , , One of the most effective strategies to increase visits is to generate engagement. The WSJ recently published an article about crowdsourcing in museums: Sta Cruz Museum achieved twice more visitors, 4 times more donations and a whooping 20 times more grants by adopting a more participative approach in the last 3 years., , Â , , Unique Visitors (UV) is a digital platform to manage and promote visitors\u2019 participation, creating engagement. Our concept is to crowdsource museum tours. We will make it extremely easy and intuitive for anyone to create and share their recommendations inside a museum., , Â , , Visitors will become prosumers, creating a recommendation database that will help future visitors to have better and personalized experiences. Prosumers become ambassadors, inviting friends to visit the museum. In this virtuous cycle we generate engagement and create UGC., , Â , , Value proposition, , Â , , Boost visits, ,  Improve visitors\u2019 experience,   Increase recurrence,   Participation/engagement,   Synergies with other museum, sharing audiences,   Improve CRM and personalized communication,   Empower visitors to recruit new audiences,  ,  Create UGC and increase online impact,  Structure recommendations in a repository that will be useful for other visitors,   Facilitate sharing of compelling content on social networks,   New ways of seeing the same collection,  ,  Get metrics,  Track user interaction on dashboard,   Segmented data: Demographics (age, gender, origin), habits (schedules, preferences, recurrence), motivation (search), interest (heat map) and satisfaction (ratings, comments),  ,  Reduce costs of mobile user acquisition, Â , , Business Model, , Â , , Instead of creating isolated digital projects, museums can subscribe to UV. Pricing will vary from 2.000\u20ac to 10.000\u20ac annually (rev. model and pricing were contrasted with managers of top Barcelona museums)., , Â , , It is a scalable B2B business model. When we acquire a solid user base, UV can pivot or expand to other models (B2C)., , Â , , Competitive advantage, , Â , , We developed a throwaway prototype (proof of concept) where we tested demand and interest of museums and visitors. We also tested usability and UX. We have 225 users and 418 newsletter subscribers (50% of which are museum professionals)., , Â , , UV is endorsed by Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya and FundaciÃ³ TÃ pies (see letters of recommendation).

The platform will receive incoming video streams, either taken from a recorded file or from a camera live stream, and will allow the user to configure one or more measuring locations, typically placed along the road lanes. The system will detect and count vehicle moving on motor lanes (such as cars, trucks, buses, bikes), and bycicle or pedestrian moving on dedicated lanes. , Today this task is carried out in most cases manually by operators acting for private companies, severely limiting the amount of data that can be actually produced with a typical budget. For instance, the UKDepartment for Transport carry out each year traffic counts from about 8.000 locations, where each site is counted on one single day in that year for a twelve hours period (http://goo.gl/cxxglb). It is obvious how the proposed automatic system could improve on the time each site is analyzed.   , The intended business model is to sell the service to professionals like city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers, who typically requires traffic flow data to conduct a variety of planning and operational activities. , The approach could be further expanded to include other types of video analytics in the future, for instance extracting information from people moving in large public places, a topic that is still currently actively researched in the computer vision community. On similar lines, other type of streaming media could be connected to the platform, such as audio sensors. , As a final note, we would like to point that this is not a project for building a video surveillance network: we will take in great care of the people's privacy, and all the information extracted by the system will be fully and completely anonymized.

Therefore, the 'needs' premise is created naturally pushed by the law. Once FI-Sonic project comprises several physical and logical modules for sound acquisition and processing system to deliver summarised audio results or streams of audio in real time, the sound field in a urban area can be analysed easily. Moreover, information of sound events, such as location of noise sources and identification of the type of sound is provided to help security departments of municipalities acting faster. Exposure of populations to excessive and long-term noise levels is known as having a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens. This issue causes a number of behavioural effects on humans such as concentration, communication disturbance and sleep disruption with direct consequences on effective performance on the work. Acoustic maps represent an essential element of acoustic expertise and acoustic studies, that involve: planning of residential areas, spatial development plans, rational management of emissions, identification of noise sources responsible for exceeding noise limit values in the area, etc.. The emerging IoT, supported by the concept of Smart Cities, can be utilized effectively for managing urban environments since it offers ubiquitous sensing and actuation. The sound sensors network is a mean of delivering in real time specific sound features capable of determining exactly the occurrence of sound events location for security and surveillance purposes or just giving tools and mechanisms for control the road traffic in order to maintain the maximum noise allowed in urban areas. This can be done by adjusting the speed limits of the vehicles in specific streets and avenues. The traditional WSNs offer the advantage of obtaining uninterrupted data but requires new infrastructure to be installed. The project FI-sonic consists of developing the necessary low-cost technology to capture sound, using both pressure microphones and accelerometers devices, to integrate existing frameworks in city environments. The project also includes processing this information with intelligent audio analytics, useful to create dynamic real-time noise maps and identify and localize a set of different sound events.

The SOUL solution is planned to help people to improve health and wellbeing. It also provides a tool to check air quality and environment. The SOER 2015 report of The European Environment Agency gives a deeply concerned perspective about air quality in EU28: \u201cair pollution remains a major environmental health risk, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer, and other health effects.\u201d The impact on economy is tremendous: number of premature death was nearly 450,000 in 2011; increasing rate of the incidence of a wide range of diseases; direct and indirect costs up 940 billion\u20ac/year. Although EU created several directives  to improve air quality toward a reduction of chemical and particles in air, it is clear from the World Health Organization reports that most of the population are repeatedly exposed to high concentration of harmful gases without knowing. Chemicals like ozone, nitric oxides, carbon monoxide, and particles (PM2.5 and PM10) are jeopardizing human health., Sensor Observation of Urban Life project focus on exposure minimization to risk of the individuals creating a network of air quality sensors. The box-sensor will be installed in public transportations mapping in real-time and dynamically each city. Using open source technology and a set of air quality sensors, the Internet-of-Things infrastructure will feed the FIWARE technology. Air quality smart-alerts/information will be issued by the use of generic enablers providing the link between the geotagged parameters and the users in mobile and web platforms. Although the SOUL box-sensor may account several diseases, the main focus will be on asthma and respiratory pathologies for which  chemical parameters are well known to trigger or potentiate crises., SOUL project not only will collect data, but it will also perform mathematical analysis to create predicting models and adaptive algorithms of air quality indexes for users. Other use of data is also envisaged for civil protection, environmental regulators and governance to become a decision tool for better traffic management and political decision of smart cities.

This data is crucial not only for the farmers to trace the feed consumed daily by animals or to generate the replenishment orders on time, but also for their suppliers to optimize feed production and delivery logistics plans. The traditional telemetry solutions, designed originally for industry market, have not succeeded for this use case. The causes are the special characteristics of the farm (difficult access to a quality electrical grid, poor or no M2M coverage, bulk solids difficult to measure, etc.) and the limited budget available per silo. Consequently, and despite of his importance, the way the stocks are being controlled is manual and very inefficient. Usually, the farmers have to climb to the silos and make a visual estimation of stocks. This is a dangerous activity that also is not performed as often as it should, causing inefficiencies and disruptions in the business processes: lack of daily consumption information, urgent purchase orders caused by broken stocks, failure to properly plan the feed production, etc. Our solution to the problem is Smart Silo, a READY-TO-USE, HIGHLY-EFFICIENT and LOW-COST platform for remote control of stocks in feed silos in the environment of a farm. It is composed of a new high-tech device and an advanced cloud platform for data acquisition and presentation. The following key features makes our platform an affordable and optimal solution for the use case: - 3D scanning of feed surface for accurate measurements. - Connection to Internet through a Wireless Sensor Network, allowing communications in areas of low or no coverage. - Solar powered device, to be autonomous from electrical grid of the farm. - Easy Plug&Sense installation. - Free available apps (web, mobile and RESTFUL API). - Low acquisition cost and zero maintenance.

One aspect of personal transportation that is neglected in the innovation whirlwind is parking., , Whether people choose to park on the street (with or without incurring fees) or in a purposefully set up gated parking space, there is still a big pain in locating an available parking spot that is close by, with acceptable pricing (\u201cacceptable\u201d as defined per each consumer\u2019s view)., , We took on the challenge of parking automation, by providing parking lots and garages with sensors that integrate in their current solution, and remove the synchronization problems. Through this more accurate model of reality, we can provide both consumers and businesses with services and optimized processes, which are not otherwise possible., In order to address the market in an exhaustive manner, we crowd-source discovery of free on-street parking spaces to motorists, using our mobile applications. By keeping their smartphones oriented with the back towards the street, drivers help our app (the same app used to discover gated parking spots) to discover free parking spaces on the street, through video processing. We have developed a proprietary solution to identify such free spaces (by analyzing shapes of cars in different positions on the road, and templates of on-road-painted traffic marks), using a neuronal network which we train on videos captured in real-life driving situations. ParkUP is addressing the Mobility Management because of the huge market potential: 5 percent compound annual revenue growth to \u20ac5.6 billion by 2021., , Trends: Rising traffic congestion and air pollution, driven by urbanization, are sparking demand for tools that get vehicles to their destinations more efficiently. The growth potential is greatest in China and the U.S. This feature will allow OEMs to invest in integrated mobility management systems that generate long-term incremental revenue. Because cities will need to use this type of data, generated by mobile cameras for many multiple purposes like surveillance, city administration and many more.  Users in this consumer market have a huge pain, especially for those living in European cities  "},{"id_internal":"fe891544-41ca-4513-84f2-05c7d968815e","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"SOUL-FI","Q1_2":"United Kingdom","Q1_3":"Humanity Online Ltd","Q1_4":"engage.re","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"6.00","Q1_8":"1.00","Q1_9":"10000.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"PEP Proxy ,IoT Broker,Identity Management","Q1_13":"75000.00","Q1_16":"1.40","Q2_1":"TRL3","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"A","Q2_5":"B","Q3_2a":"0.00","Q3_2b":"30.00","Q3_2c":"70.00","Q3_4":"C","Q3_5":"C","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"A","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"B","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"25.00","Q4_3b":"584.00","Q4_3c":"614.00","Q4_3d":"200.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"75000.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEFENCE; COMPULSORY SOCIAL SECURITY","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Team Collaborative Applications","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Collaborative Applications","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"engage.re aims to help communities work together by enabling public, private and voluntary sectors to combine knowledge, efforts and resources.

The problem is that European countries have transposed the Directive to national laws in so different ways that there are currently normative differences regarding to pesticide use restrictions among countries. For example, a European country can allow the use of a pesticide forbidden in other European countries. Selling or exporting incorrectly treated products leads to product image damage, restrictions to sale and severe fines due to the health risk caused. In order to offer a solution to this problem, this project will provide a useful system for helping agricultural companies and individual farmers in the task of choosing the most suitable pesticide for their crops avoiding potential risks to human health and environment. The project aims to build a system that centralizes all the information about the authorized pesticides in each European country. The sources are open datasets about pesticides that are published by official organizations from the different countries. The information about pesticides will be enriched with open geographic information in order to make easier its final exploitation. We envision three main components oriented to different kind of users and clients: a free-of-charge application to obtain basic information about pesticides, a premium version with added-value tools, and a web API orientedto developers that are willing to build tools and applications related to pesticides.

Our approach is based from the perspective of the internet of things leveraging the FI-Ware platform. Increase in the cost of production, abolishment of the quota system will put pressure on dairy farmers to find new ways to optimize their farm production [1]. Estrus detection is one of the fundamental optimization points in operations and can save farmers significant amounts of money, up to \u20ac250/year per cow. While current detection systems provide adequate accuracy, they are mostly based on algorithms designed for indoor/shed base farms. Furthermore, the business model is based on monolithic implementations based on devices that require fixed capital investments. These systems are usually out of reach of small to medium sized farms. Also, the technology is fixed and cannot be adapted to changing farmer needs and scale. In the future it is anticipated that farms will need to optimize their facilities for greenhouse emissions, animal welfare and production per cow require systems which not only measure but also provide a scientific basis for prediction and control. Sensor based solutions will be required to scale and adapt to these needs. For farmers, an optimal solution would be to invest in systems that can adapt and morph as the needs change. In order to detect estrus and animal behavior, our solution uses sensors mounted on cows and connected to our cloud services platform providing a unique approach to estrus detection leveraging deep learning, life-time data storage and FI-Ware integration to enable new services based on sensor networks. Our approach is transmutable to different scenarios within the farm environment and currently does not have any direct competition.

We offer control and saving for transport and logistics related to Waste handling. DECHET SMART CITY. WASTE MANAGEMENT FOR CLEANER & OPTIMIZED SMART CITIES wants to improve the way cities manage their Wastes.  , Cities usually contract different companies for the management and treatment of waste, that is collected by stablished schedules, both for dangerous and for non-dangerous wastes. These companies bill the city for the amount of waste threated, that keeps private; and also bill for the frequency of waste collection. They work based on fixed schedules, not being aware of waste container status. This makes waste storage facilities and containers at the cities vulnerable, having security issues due to some hazardous materials that should remain as less time as possible at these facilities. This also is not cost-effective, as sometimes trucks travel to some waste facilities to find that the containers are almost empty, or need several displacements due to containers above capacity., Through this product, we plan to integrate smart cities, waste companies and citizens, allowing a smart treatment of waste that needs less transportation, and less effort, with more organized process, reducing its cost, and its impact on citizens., Our goal is to make the smart city, the waste companies, the smart containers and the citizen to communicate in a four way system, developing a service that made this communication possible, enhancing it with citizen requests and information. This will make cities or provincial deputation aware of their waste container and facilities status, not only aware of the amount of waste collected every day or week. This will also create Open Data for the citizens to know how wastes are handled.

The goal is the monetizing of this service and the acceleration and better monetization of 3D assets for our clients and the entertainment industry as a whole., , Â , , The concept:, , The idea started from a clear need to enhance interoperability between traditional media production and the converging media production. This need has become clear to us in collaborating with many clients within the film, animation and advertising industry. One of our clients defines this need as follows:, , Â , , &lt;The media industry is looking for new revenue models better adapted to \u201cthe age of free\u201d and the \u201cscreen-hopping generation\u201d. Transmedia, releasing content across media, is a powerful way to generate additional income ... how they can best be exploited and how they can be developed in the most cost-efficient way, both technologically and creatively\u2026 &gt;, , Â , , AtEx aims to greatly reduce the existing barrier between 3D Design packages, multi platform game engines and HTML5 WebGL based solutions. This will result in either a web based service (FIWARE enabled) or a combination of a web based service with stand alone plug-ins. We are certain that this prototyping phase will give us the necessary insights to decide on the final marketable form of our solution., , Â , , The customers problem:, , The media industry is challenged Â to answer the increasing need of consumers as they are getting more used and demanding to consume content anywhere, anytime and anyhow., , But the content\u2019s adapation to enable a max of benefit from all types of media consumption, increases the cost of that adaptation. Well adapted content sells better, but comes to a higher cost. Adapting content is a creative challenge, decreasing the cost a technical one. In fact, lowering the technical cost enables a higher ROI and releases more budget for creative development of content. It is exactly this need we are trying to resolve with AtEx., , On a technical and operational level we can identify the problems as follows., , Game developers and 3D artists have issues achieving proper interoperability of 3D sets/scenes between 3D Design packages and game engines. As for simple objects the interoperability is almost guaranteed, for complex scenes there still is an issue:, , e.g : typical headache: http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/158164/unity-importing-instances-wrong-via-fbx.html, , Â , , As a Movie and Animation Studio, we are often asked to deliver 3D assets to gaming companies. Currently we are working closely together with a gaming company on a couple of projects. We encounter a lot of issues while trying to transfer our 3D scenes seamlessly into a 3D game engine (Unity or WebGL). These issues take time to be resolved and consume consequently a lot of money., , Â , , This is not only an expensive process for our clients (Game and Film producers) but also for the directors of the production companies and the creative directors at studios around the world., , Therefore the \u2018added value\u2019 we offer answers the need from an international and dynamic market, open to innovative approaches., , Possible Clients and competitive advantage:, , The possible clients for our service are producers, post-production/game companies and app developers. Our software considerably improves the workflow between these parties. It allows them to connect the different software they use and synchronize their workflows. It even helps to build a bridge between the cultures of game development and audiovisual post-production., , In att.( 3.2) a clear view of the needs of the industry.

For most farms, farming activities are not properly logged at least not in a systematic way so that cost analysis can be performed to find out critical cost factors that could be avoided in order to minimize costs and maximize productivity. Individual farmers need IT tools that will enable them to log and calculate costs, plan ahead and make informed decisions on what crops to plant, what farming activities to execute and what inputs to use, based not only crop and farming requirements but also based on financial considerations. Such tools should be able to provide a 'good enough' approximation of the cost and profitability analysis using acceptable 'default values' - typical costs per input and activity, in order to compensate for the lack of accurate data logs typical in a small size farm. Agrostis, develops and markets ifarma, an integrated Farm Management App for both individual farmers and farmer groups. ifarma is provided as Saas both as a native mobile app and as a web-cloud based application. ifarma features a powerful financial analysis module that includes farm profitability analysis and cost analysis at three levels: field, crop and farm. The aim of the proposed project is to make ifarma's financial analysis module available as an App on the FISpace platform utilizing FIWare technologies. The Farm's Financial Analysis (FFA) FISpace App, will provide an interoperable service in the FISPace platform receiving field, crop and cultivation task data and using existing ifarma module as a backend service will a) Display a profitability and cost analysis dashboard as a widget on the FISpace and b) provide the resulting analyses as output via the FISpace platform for use by other Apps and services.

In some places it is too dangerous to even get out of the hotel alone, because of intense criminal activity. However, most places are not really more dangerous than one's own home neighbourhood. It is the fear of the unknown that can pin people down, keeping them from enjoying their vacations to the maximum. Things can get even worse when one has a medical condition or is a bit older, in which case even the slightest problem seems impossible to handle. Based on experience from our own families and friends, we have come to the conclusion that often all people need to go out and live a bit more carelessly is a slight nudge and the mere possibility of a helping hand being nearby; the belief that someone will notice and help soon enough if one falls down or is attacked can make all the difference for \"\"weaker\"\" or more scared individuals., , Modern social networking can provide the basis of a very comforting solution for such situations, lowering existing barriers and enabling people to go out more, feeling just safe enough. We aim to start by creating a large enough global group of people, who care to help in such cases for various reasons, personal or professional. People living in an island that depends on tourism, for example, would probably like to help tourists feel safer, both because they may be nice, kind people, but also because the safer tourists feel, the more they will go out and the more money they will spend on the island's stores. Large hotels and their staff also care to have their visitors feel as safe as possible, since this will bring higher profit to the hotels' stores and more and more visitors to them in the long run. Smart City technologies and the Internet of Things can offer useful sensors, data, and services that can be exploited via FIWARE by STROLL, location information and geotagging being perfect examples for this.,  \" "},{"id_internal":"edf60942-c03e-4697-ae54-4ecc6a3cbc60","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FI-C3","Q1_2":"France","Q1_3":"Kissmyshoe","Q1_4":"Kissmyshoe","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"4.00","Q1_8":"3.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_12":"Publish/Subscribe Context Broker,POI Data Provider ,Complex Event Processing,BigData Analysis","Q1_13":"110000.00","Q1_16":"0.00","Q2_1":"TRL7","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2h":"10.00","Q3_2j":"75.00","Q3_2k":"15.00","Q3_3a":"N","Q3_4":"F,D,B,A","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"A","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"C","Q3_12":"F","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"100.00","Q4_3b":"150.00","Q4_3c":"150.00","Q4_3d":"200.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"30.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer shopping","B2B_B2C":"B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"X","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"Because the retail market has late in using innovating digital solution and is a a huge and penetrable market.

As consumers, we increasingly rely on subscription or pay-per-use services. Software vendors have tapped into this trend with Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS applies subscription, freemium, pay-per-use revenue models to give customers the flexibility they demand, using the Cloud. Using SaaS SMEs can access solutions that only large enterprises could once afford to buy (and sell, in the case of software companies)., The SaaS sector is booming, with revenues forecasted to reach $106B in 2016 (Forrester). Almost 2/3 of the revenue are generated in the SaaS enterprise application marketplaces, where many SaaS solutions are sold. All the major web and desktop applications (Salesforce, Photoshop, Word) have been migrated to the cloud - a process known as SaaSification. However, entering the SaaS market is complex and expensive and thus inhibits the majority of small Software Vendors - approximately 300.000 EU/USA SMEs for a loss of \u20ac7.1 billion a year., , Indeed to deploy their software as a cloud based SaaS application, software vendors must rewrite the code; select a cloud service provider; integrate their application onto that provider\u2019s platform; set up billing procedures; run tests; and monitor each customer\u2019s installation., ClouDesire is a game-changing enterprise application marketplace, which allows for the easy and rapid, SaaSification. Software Vendors can now compete with the big players., With ClouDesire, the ISV only needs to upload a ZIP file with the software source code and select the VM requirements for the application (2 hours). ClouDesire automatically manages the application deployments, the billing to the customer, the software upgrades, etc. When purchasing an application from the ClouDesire marketplace, the customers select their preferred cloud provider and proceed to order the application (15 minutes)., With SaaSi-FI we want to increase the level of flexibility required by the SaaS market. Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), especially small and mid sized, who do not have the resources to sell and deploy their web/desktop applications as SaaS, comprise our primary selected addressable market (SAM) - approx. 300k ISVs. The business model that underpins our commercialization strategy is the creation of our public application marketplace targeted at ISVs. Our commercial pipeline includes steps to gain relevant market traction and become appealing for software vendors to jump on board. This consists of B2B sales of the whitelabel marketplace to telco\u2019s and system integrators.  SOHO/SMEs., , Our final consumer market is the target market of the ISVs joining ClouDesire, which mainly includes small businesses., ,  not applicable "},{"id_internal":"3993fca3-1c05-45d1-8d68-3a0536d65aa3","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"SpeedUp Europe","Q1_2":"Germany","Q1_3":"ERGON Datenprojekte GmbH ","Q1_4":"GeoInfo4Kids","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"12.00","Q1_8":"18.00","Q1_9":"1700000.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Identity Management,GIS Data Provider","Q1_13":"45000.00","Q1_16":"14.00","Q2_1":"TRL5","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"15.00","Q3_2b":"80.00","Q3_2c":"5.00","Q3_4":"D,A","Q3_5":"B,A","Q3_6":"2015","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"A","Q3_11":"B","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"1000.00","Q4_3b":"400.00","Q4_3c":"300.00","Q4_3d":"200.00","Q4_4":"A","Q4_5":"A","Q4_6":"33.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer leisure/gaming","B2B_B2C":"B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Spatial Information Management Software","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Application Development & Deployment","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Data Access, Analysis, and Delivery Software","SME_STARTUP":"Other","full_text":"GeoInfo4Kids is a map-based information system that collects different kinds of information about places and sights of interest for children.

MultiYou., , Â , , MultiDub, synchronous multilingual dubbing in movie theaters., , Â , , MultiDub is a smartphone app that allows cinema spectators to watch the movie being projected on the screen in the language of their choice. The procedure is simple: with a pair of earphones, the user enters the cinema and when the film begins, by just a single tap, the smartphone records a snippet of the ambient sound (i.e. from the loudspeakers). Technically, after this, MultiDub analyzes the spectral contents of the snippet and extracts a set of unique features that are transmitted to a remote server that will identify the film and the time position that corresponds to the moment when the fragment of audio was captured. This way, it is possible for the server to let the user know which languages are available. Next, the user chooses the language and the server provides him/her with the corresponding streaming audio. Then, MultiDub outputs it at the client-side by seamlessly synchronizing the sound with the images in motion that are projected on the cinema screen. Actually, and as one of our main unique selling propositions, the user still benefits from the acoustic conditions of the hall, without noticing the interference of the original dubbing emanating from the surrounding loudspeakers. This is carried out thanks to the support for specific digital processing techniques that allows MultiDub to combine the sound effects of the movie (only music and other effects from the ambient audio) with the dubbed conversations that are sent to MultiDub, while minimizing the interference due to the voices of the ambient sound. This way, the user transparently senses the audio as though he was not listening to any earphone, while profiting from the special acoustic conditions of the hall., , Â , , As of MultiDub\u2019s target market, Spainis one of the most powerful tourism economies in the world, receiving each year around 80 million foreign (non-Spanish-speaking) visitors who cannot have any access to movie theaters because of their limited knowledge of Spanish. Actually, only 1% of all cinemas in Spainprovide films in original version. Moreover, an increasing number of Spanish-speaking individuals prefer to watch multimedia contents in original version, due mainly to the richness and subtleties of real cast dialogues. As an archetypical MultiDub user, we can relate our target customer to the profile of a foreign tourist that does not speak the language of the movie. Around 30/40 years old, British nationality, single or married. In Spainfor holidays (non-resident) or for retirement (resident). She/he likes to attend cultural activities and loves watching movies. Note: the British community represents the third major group of resident foreigners after Rumanians and Moroccans, and the first non-resident foreign tourist segment., , Â , , According to our Business Model, MultiDub makes money by relaying on micro-payments and advertising. The central product is the \u201cDubble\u201d, i.e. a packet of alternative dubbings that the user downloads to the mobile platform in order to enjoy the film according to his/her preferences. A user can have access to Dubbles according to two different modes: (1) By micro-paying for each Dubble directly (better sound quality, no advertisement, etc.), i.e. Dubble HiFi, and (2) Free (with sporadic ads supported commercially by a unit of advertising content, called \u201cDubAd\u201d), i.e. Dubble Free. The advertisements that support Dubble Free financially correspond to the DubAd product, which can be described as a unit of advertising content offered to individuals or corporations.

Door locks have existed for well over 2000 years.Now they are more complex and sophisticated but the principle is the same.Locks are effective with designs proving very difficult to pick;but the mechanical lock does have some serious limitations and security issues:, - To allow access to 3rd parties when absent,we must give them a key or hide it,which can cause security issues, - Often,keys are not returned,so locks should be changed, - When keys are returned,how do we know if other keys have been cut?, - If someone tries to or forces a lock or uses an illegally held key,the administrator has no warning and no record of when it occurred, - If keys are lost you have to call a locksmith or force entry, - When dealing with more than one property,many keys accumulate and this can become an administration nightmare, , SmartLock offers greater security and convenience to the user:, - Administrators can give access to a secure area on a very limited basis without a physical key.SL will communicate with internal devices such as security systems and other internal SLs to control access within this area.A complete record will be given through the IoT cloud.An example:a plumber only given access to the kitchen, - Key privileges can be terminated at any time, - There is no risk of additional keys existing, - Inbuilt accelerometers will detect attempted forced entry.Through the IoT cloud,the date and time of the event will be recorded and the administrator will be notified immediately.SL can turn on lights and issue verbal warnings to the perpetrator, - SL can be operated with a mobile application.If the mobile device is lost or forgotten,SL can be operated via the IoT cloud using another device or laptop, - SL credentials can be reset via the IoT cloud if the control device is stolen or lost, - A miniature peep hole camera can identify who is requesting entry.Access can be permitted remotely, - An inbuilt microphone and speaker can provide communication between the administrator and 3rd party "},{"id_internal":"2264cdef-dea6-4cb9-9b60-35674ff32c11","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FI-C3","Q1_2":"Estonia","Q1_3":"Medical Technology Group OÃ","Q1_4":"MACHETE","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"2.00","Q1_8":"1.00","Q1_9":"130000.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Object Storage GE ,Monitoring GE,IaaS Resource Management GE ,BigData Analysis","Q1_13":"98000.00","Q1_16":"4.00","Q2_1":"TRL7","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"B","Q3_2b":"40.00","Q3_2i":"60.00","Q3_3a":"D","Q3_4":"F","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"B","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"B","Q3_12":"F","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"80.00","Q4_3b":"60.00","Q4_3c":"60.00","Q4_3d":"40.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"10.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Horizontal (solutions suitable for every verticals)","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Content Analytics, Discovery, and Cognitive Software","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Content Applications","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"Advertising networks Visual discovery is what we do and it is most prominent in fashion ecommerce.

In other words, it is for use by students who are sitting side-by-side in the same room. The problem that Slam addresses is the difficulty integrating 21st century teaching and learning into the traditional classroom, something widely agreed as critical for socioeconomic progress. In particular, Slam addresses the development of 21st century skills of collaboration,communication and problem-solving in tandem with mastery learning of educational material. To achieve this, we locally connect individual student devices, and engage groups of students in distributed, interactive exercises., , Facilitating productive peer learning in the classroom is a real challenge. It takes much time to prepare and requires a special skill set in teachers. Slam requires almost no preparation time, and enables teachers to spend more time one-on-one with students and less time orchestrating the class activity. , , Another barrier to peer learning is that virtually all educational content is designed to be consumed by an individual, which enables stronger students to take over all the work, thus leaving weaker students without learning opportunities. Such poor group dynamics make peer learning experiences ineffective and frustrating. , , For effective peer learning, it is important that students maintain ownership over their own progress, while also being interdependent with their peers. Individuals need to be accountable to the group and to themselves. We are confident that Slam achieves these aims.

Nowadays, in the night-time cities are constantly illuminated by street lighting; from dusk till dawn, public and private lights enlighten streets, public gardens, parking, industries, etc. despite people actually spend time there. This results in a huge waste of energy due to the fact that during the night most of the time outdoor public and private places have very low frequency of human activities. This is especially true in suburban areas located at the edge of cities and in the country side where most of the social activities happens during the day., The goal of the project is to support a novel smart real-time lighting product, enlightening locations only if actually required. To this purpose, our product will recognize basic human activities, e.g., people walking, bike riding, and car driving, to dynamically change street lighting on/off status and intensity to fulfil the light needs. For instance, people crossing a street may require intense localized lighting to allow approaching cars to spot people in advance while bike riders could benefit from intense lighting where they currently are and soft lighting along the street in the direction of bikes., The project will adopt low cost arrays of infrared camera to monitor target areas and detect any motion: whenever an infrared camera perceives a movement, it notifies the cloud-based system in charge of applying pattern recognition algorithms to detected the type of movement. Whenever there is no movements (or detected movement is not interesting, e.g., foliage movements due to the wind) overall street illumination is reduced by either decreasing light intensity or switching off (part of) light spots. We believe that our novel product will be highly beneficial in a wide set of environments, allowing to achieve huge energy saving in both public and private illumination areas.

Many of such services are based on various types of monitoring activities, like monitoring the vital parameters (e.g. measuring blood pressure regularly), monitoring the physical activity of caretakers (e.g. not to lay in the bed too long), monitoring the environmental condition (e.g. not to walk too long on a hot day), whereas most of them can be performed remotely. We argue that smart cities, as places where an enormous majority of caretakers live, have to provide a solid infrastructure for the realization of such caregiving services, especially through the provision of different types of information which are relevant for caretakers and their health status (e.g. microclimate condition, level of air-pollution, noise-level, etc.)., In this proposal we propose a mobile solution which will reuse the smart city information infrastructure for the provisioning of monitoring-based caregiving services based on a novel technology for hybrid complex event processing, partially implemented using FIWARE technology, which enables continuous personalized and proactive monitoring of caretakers, including alarming caregivers and families before some critical situation might happen., The main goal is to increase the quality of life and safety of caretakers, but also their families who will be very interested in paying for such remote monitoring. The system will be provided as Solution as a Service, including a mobile app, server-side and web-portal parts, with the main revenue streams coming from subscription fees and advertisement.

However, due to to the generic nature of our concept more of these markets hold intriguing options and will be \"\"attacked\"\"\" Market potential + see comments above The consumer market isn't our primary objective due to a lot of other opportunities - see above. However, if innovations in certain areas lead to the consumer market our concept is ready for it. The Internet of Things (IoT) is foreseen to enable similar changes as the Internet revolution, making the physical world as economically liquid, personalized and efficient as the digital one. , Bosolog Aps wants to develop a smart solution that targets existing, unmet needs in the IoT market \u2013 an innovative system for real time monitoring of foods, expensive arts and other valuable assets (mobile and fixed) all both during storage, transportation and at the user site. Our innovative concept encompasses elements such as: fully automated business logics, accurate mapping; real-time monitoring of several parameters and personal alerting by exceptions; proactive maintenance; and support to tactical and operational decision-making. The usage of the Bosolog product is very generic and concerns many different sectors. In this application, we have chosen to illustrate the potential of following markets concerning SmartCities: 1. Meal delivery to elderly in nursing- and care home; 2. Transportation of art in state authorized museums 3. Public bus passenger transportation security & comfort and 4. Public disability/elderly driving service security & comfort. We at Bosolog estimate a total market potential of approximately \u20ac6,2 million a year only in Denmark for the four areas, based on data collected from the Danish Transport Authority and Danish Culture Agency. Bosolog will in year 3 have gained a market share of 1 %  with a turnover of \u20ac8,3 million . This is only a small fraction of the total share for Bosolog, due its generic applicability, both describing and monitoring the object in question and its surroundings. It is easy to implement, because there is no need to make any constructional changes for the customers.,   "},{"id_internal":"5388c7fe-d126-4974-960f-0bdcf8d324e9","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"CEED Tech","Q1_3":"Stream.Plus Ltd","Q1_4":"Stream+","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"4.00","Q1_8":"2.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_12":"Identity Management","Q1_13":"30000.00","Q1_16":"0.00","Q2_1":"TRL8","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2f":"30.00","Q3_2i":"70.00","Q3_3a":"K","Q3_4":"F","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"A","Q3_12":"F","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"0.00","Q4_3b":"4500.00","Q4_3c":"400.00","Q4_3d":"400.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"0.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"TELECOM AND MEDIA","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"X","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Content Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Content Applications","SME_STARTUP":"Startup","full_text":"We are offering a marketing solution for any company.

Also, there exist 12 million farmers in EU of which 7 out of 10 are under 65 years old., The BIOMAS project will introduce the mechanisms that will open up the biomass market to small-medium European biomass stakeholders and strengthen their market position., Through the BIOMAS platform and mobile app, biomass suppliers will be encouraged to enter the biomass market offering their biomass products that otherwise will remain unexploited due to lack of sufficient support and consultation or lack of appropriate means of transport. Using BIOMAS, they can cooperate with other biomass suppliers or biomass providers offering advanced biomass services. On the other side, biomass consumers will be free to buy and combine offers from multiple biomass suppliers, thus promoting competition., The big picture is that BIOMAS will create a new market without intermediate resellers., In particular, biomass suppliers/service providers will benefit from economies of scale since they will offer their biomass products/services on a European wide basis. Also, it will promote cooperation and competition. Biomass suppliers will easier establish collaborations and provide more advanced services competing with well-established actors in the biomass market. On the other side, BIOMAS will make life easier and cheaper for biomass consumers. They can find best-priced offers. Also, they can check the availability and location of biomass products and predict how prices decrease or rise over the year.

Hence, municipalities and organisations managing urbans space are its natural customer. The concept of public reporting can be extended to private companies with action on the public space. Construction companies can also use the service for budgeting repairs. As above. Municipalities and other public space management companies are the natural customers for SperoCity. Contractors can benefit from maintenance & repairs assignments. Also, data-seeking companies may be interested in the data acquired by the system, and IoT companies may want to use automated reporting based on SperoCity. The goal of this project is to develop and comercialize an innovative set of web-based products directed at organizations (public or private) that carry out activities related to management and maintenance of facilities and networks in an urban environment. Named \u201cSpero\u201d, these products are based on the paradigms of the Internet of Everything, cloud computing, collaborative systems and empowerment, paradigms that mark a shift to a new era of opportunity for consumers, businesses and governments. The product's basic functionality allows citizens and company clients or employees, who are daily in touch with the urban facilities/networks, by means of a mobile device to report georreferenced occurrences (anomalies, problems) which call for repairs or intervention. The system may be setup to interact with social networks and, through them, allow reports to be followed, commented and cross-checked. Spero includes a professional backoffice that receives, organizes and analyses the incoming occurrences with scientific decision support tools. The tools inspect the relevance of the occurrences and rank/classify them, emitting (at request) automatic alerts for urgent cases and periodic reports. All this helps in designing optimized intervention plans. Incorporation of these tools is one of the more innovative aspects of Spero and adds to its value proposition The system architecture is based on cloud concepts, it is very flexible and continuously adapts to the specificities of each city or organization. Cloud usage permits virtually unlimited scalability of Spero and its application at a global scale. Spero has two components: (1) reporting and monitoring, which is open for all the public to participate and may incorporate already existing open data, and (2) the backoffice, which is for professional use by organisations, to be comercialised on a license basis.

Therefore, most farmers end up making poor decisions, which are not based on data. Agroptima is a simple and modern mobile APP and a cloud software tool for farmers, designed with farmers. It will have a simple interface and farmers can work from the fields without internet connection. Agroptima allows the farmer to keep record of his activities, crops and to analyze costs, based on real data he gathers with his smartphone. In addition, the cloud will have an API to connect to the machines so machine generated data can be used for further decision making. The benefits for the farmer: - Manage his farm efficiently from anywhere - Save time by keeping records from the field, so when he arrives home most administrative work is done - Have real data to make better decisions - Concentrate all his information in one single place - Be more competitive, by identifying which crops, fields, machines or workers have better productivity. Improve decisions on his inputs, crop planning, investment in machinery, hiring, etc. The 2 differences between us and other companies who might have a similar idea is that first, we focus on mobile, because agriculture is mobile and second, we focus on use of machine generated data to improve the decision-making of the farmer. Our vision is to modernize farm management. We think that farmers are the most important player in this challenge, and our tool is designed with them in mind. We now need SmartAgriFood funding to accelerate our development. Help us make our vision come true!

Elmitel Sensing will allow usage of data from its wireless sensor networks inside applications, developed on FIspace. A complete sensor network based decision support solution in the area of vineyard management, addressing vineyard managers and vineyard advisories, will be developed inside the Elmitel Sensing at the beginning, by using the FIspace platform. The main commercial drawback of wireless sensor networks today is that applications that rely on them, need to be set up by IT experts, because of the set up complexity. This implies higher cost (and in some regions also unavailability) of the solutions, based on the wireless sensor network technology, as well as lower flexibility of the solution in terms of network topology changes and network expansion. Elmitel Sensing addresses this drawback and turns wireless sensor network set-up into a process that can be accomplished by non-IT personnel (like farmers), because this recently became possible and feasible with the availability of modular hardware and IoT cellular plans. The consequence is a wireless sensor network that costs less and is more flexible and easier to upgrade, while all of the data processing for particular crop is done in the cloud. Supported sensor network hardware is already available in the EU and globally.

Although most information is publicly available, it is scattered over different government data silos in many member states. Open Check embraces the European PSI Directive as a huge opportunity to lower the barrier to access business information, raise transparency and disrupt the often outdated and local information broker market in Europe with a multi-lingual interface built on the latest open source search technologies and FIware enablers.

The application is a decentralised fleet management tool with equal share of information among the fleet units, which operates in heterogeneous fleets independently of the machines\u2019 brand names and specifications, and disengage operators from the manually interaction with the system by giving him the ability for a complete communication with the system (for both giving or requesting information) by his/her own voice. This application overcomes the drawbacks of existing fleet management solutions which are highly depended on the machinery brand names (and thus not applicable to heterogeneous fleets), completely centralised (providing information only to the central decision maker) and require the manual interaction of the operator with the tool\u2019s interface which cost in time and concentration to another parallel task., The proposed application incorporates the following FIWARE enablers: Complex Event Processing (CEP); Identity Management (KeyRock); and the Backend Device Management (IDAS). V-AgriFleet application marketing and merchandise efforts will be directed to the following target group of customers: farmers of cereals, industrial crops, and forage crops; contractors of agricultural machinery; and farmers associations that share agricultural machinery.

At Bovicom, dairy researchers and veterinarians are trying to adapt to the wide range of new technologies. The amount of data created on a dairy farm exponentially grew over the last decade to 100 MegaBytes each day (milk meters, accelerometers and vaginal or ruminal temperature loggers). However, trying to integrate the widespread data streams from PLF technologies is tempting. MmmooOgle covers theÂ idea to have develop a smartphone application for veterinarians, farmers and other consultants, whereby the data from a newly build data warehouse (named Dairy Data Warehouse or DDW) would be used. Besides the data already available in DDW through conversions, additional information can be added to the DDW platform with the input features of the app. The app will be tightly coupled to the DDW platform as the data access and storage is based on the DDW database. Typical features that will allow the user to add data to the platform are the entry of pregnancy diagnoses, mastitis events &amp; treatments, body weight &amp; other clinical parameters, genital &amp; other clinical examination, pictures, etc. This information is then stored in the DDW platform and available for applications inside the DDW platform.Â Additionally, the app can be used to display data and reports available via HerdNet. As the MmmooOgle is built on top of DDW, it is not a competing system. Usage of the app will even stimulate farmers to work more close with their consultant, stimulate these consultants to work more close with DDW and convince them to purchase more of its features (f.i. datamarts).Â The ultimate goal of the application is to facilitate communication in the 21th century between farmers, veterinarians and the animals. Time for change, time to MmmooOgle.

Local administrations are forced to find a cost effective solution to meet the targets outlined by the White Paper on Transport and comply with air pollution limits. The EU Commission has launched legal proceedings against several European cities (23 in Germany) which have violated repeatedly air pollution limits and in many cases car traffic has been limited or completely blocked. Those targets are only achievable by fostering the paradigm of Mobility as a Service, with a convenient user-centric door-to-door car-independent lifestyle, which increases mobility of all citizens and drastically reduces the number of circulating vehicles. MVMANT is a novel mobility platform that enables the deployment of a fleet of clean vehicles circulating on fixed routes with adaptive and predictive dispatching. This means that vehicles will be available when and where needed. The aim is to fill the gap between expensive but fully personalized taxi service and cheaper but not flexible public transportation, in order to enable full transport multimodality. Our platform offers a pay-per-use travel experience, employs gamification to incentivise mobility behaviour change (virtual travel units, loyalty schemes), and leverages in-vehicle and on-station entertainment and infotainment for targeted advertising. The competitive advantage towards services like Uber is that MVMANT cooperates with incumbent PT companies, offering them a top-notch platform as a service to introduce this novel transportation mode, compliant with existing regulations. The advantage over carsharing is that customers have to drive themselves; cars have to be parked in a public space and subtract valuable areas that could be dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists; cars stand idle most of the time and are not always available where and when needed; check-in and check-out procedures take time and increase the real cost of the service. MVMANT embeds an incentive and loyalty platform based on trip units, that benefits all stakeholders in the urban ecosystem, including small businesses in the city center : e.g. a store can offer free travel units to customers; the municipality can award travel units to citizen who recycle waste. This will further reduce the price of the service, stimulating a virtual cycle of increased usage, revenues for the PT and for the platform provider. The end users of this transportation mode are city dwellers that need a reliable, convenient and comfortable door-to-door mobility without owning and/or using a car. MVMANT offers the complete enabling platform as a service and takes a commission on the trip units sold, as well on the advertising/incentive scheme.  See above The Social Commuting eXperience Platform (SCXP) is a turnkey enabler of any urban transportation franchise based on ridesharing. Our goal is to enhance urban commuting by offering all the benefits of a socializing and entertaining experience, among new profitability elements for the service provider. SXCP is an integrated solution based on a booking mobile app, a novel-billing system, an incentive and business model ecosystem and a cloud based backend orchestrator.

Still low representation of organic products in the overall agricultural production, keeps the profit margins in this sector at a very high level in the region. Serbian retail chains are no different, and contribute to high prices of organic products. One of the tools for lowering the prices would be the use of direct marketing principles, through direct connection of organic producers and their individual consumers., There is a need for development of an effective software in a form of social marketplace platform, as a communication and reputation building tool between organic producers and consumers. This platform would provide many benefits for all users, including lowering prices, more profitable and stable production, shortening the channels of distribution, faster building of organic producers\u2019 capacities, and general healthier nutrition of the population. Consumers are getting more and more aware of the food they eat. There are a number of problems they currently face in their desire to eat healthier and better food:, Availability: It is generally hard for consumers to find organic or natural food on the market., Price: Supermarkets are usually the only place but in most supermarkets in Serbia there is one uninviting shelf of semi rotten and massively overpriced products., Trust: Lots of food is bought on open markets but people don\u2019t trust the sellers. All producers and tradesmen generally claim to have organic produce., , Our platform will solve this problems. OrganicNet is a social marketplace where consumers can buy organic food directly from trusted producers and farmers.

Emotional records are also integrated with other types of data, such as current activities, location and agenda. First of all, the ReTreat bracelet connects its users to professional health care services. Depressed people often do not understand or clearly state their emotions. The bracelet also helps professional therapists to connect the dots between patientsÃ¢\u20acâ¢ emotions and effective treatment. The big amounts of data collected enable the device to identify patient-specific emotional patterns, emotional triggers, and responsiveness to different types of treatment. The bracelet connects its user to private circles of friends and family based upon their location (GPS), availability and the particular relationship to the user (friend, family member, etc.). By understanding the location (and situation) in which its users are in, the bracelet provides the most effective treatment and feedback. Furthermore, integrating emotional data and using machine learning allows the bracelet to improve the suggestions over time and provide specialized advice the next time the user finds him or her in a similar situation. To sum up, Retreat bracelet enables its users to take control of their emotions and make happiness both tangible and sustainable.

The most challenging issue for eLearning technology to become widely used is that the volume of media transmission needed to achieve substantial benefits is still very limited. WHITEboard aims at tackling this problem by building on cutting-edge technology in the field of multimedia content compression, exchange and delivery, to allow for a rich remote learning experience while exploiting the increasing ubiquity of devices such as smartphones and tablets. The main output of the project consists of a wireless application designed to create, share and display high-quality video lectures while providing real-time feedback and interaction among teachers and learners. The fundamental assumption and concept of this project revolves around the fact that external data, captured by small portable devices, along with the video signal can be manipulated and processed to assist a video encoding scheme able to support a superior eLearning system. The resulting \u201ceLearning tailored\u201d video encoder makes use of that external data to drastically improve the performance over state-of-the-art encoders by reducing computational complexity while increasing compression efficiency. Exploiting effective FIWARE assets to considerably accelerate the development of the proposed technology this project will deliver a market-ready eLearning application that overcomes the limitations of available architectures and systems.

The analysis results will help our development team create better gameplay and enhance the user experience of players. Empirical evidence from the game industry has shown that implementing changes in accordance with user analytics has substantially improved game monetization and overall enjoyment of users. Thus this system will bring considerable value to our company., , The system architecture contains 3 modules: logging user data, processing user data (crunching) and displaying analysis result. All the 3 modules will be implemented using FIWARE technologies and enablers., , Â , , Module 1: Logging user data. In this module, a RESTful web service will be developed for listening to user data collection from the game. User gameplay information will be gathered and stored in Database server in the cloud. The web service will be implemented using FIWARE cloud hosting enabler., , Â , , Module 2: Processing user data. The data collected will be periodically crunched using Big Data Analysis tools from a cloud server. The same cloud server will receive the crunched result and store it in a different database. This module will use both Cloud Hosting and Data/Context Management Enablers., , Â , , Module 3: Displaying analysis result. The crunched data will be displayed visually to the game development team via this module. The module's implementation will be a web service using FIWARE cloud hosting enabler., , Â , , Our custom deep analysis system will give us a much deeper understanding of our player base than what pre made sample based analytics tools provide. This will allow us to fine tune our game to a much greater extent. In any business one of the most important factors is understading your customers. This has never been more true than with mobile apps and games where supply is plentiful and removing a frustrating piece of software is just a tap away., , Â , , We are also hoping to invite other developers to our platform after the prototype stage to offer them a better way to understand the needs and desires of their user base. This would start to provide us with direct monetary benefit from the system in additon to the value it creates through our games., , Â , , Taking into account recent privacy concerns this system will also allow us to own our data and better protect the privacy of our users instead of submitting everything to third parties which may end up being a strategical advantage.

Usually, the bigger programs are multi partner programs, meaning consumers collect points at different stores and get something useless (bags, water kettle etc.) in return. The truth is that all of these card companies are simply keen on personal data. It is very attractive to combine consumer data with their behaviour and preferences and sell this enriched personal data afterwards to shops for marketing reasons. , Approximately 24 month ago a team of five people thought, the time has come to realise the Ã¢\u20acÅmost honest customer cardÃ¢\u20acï¿½ in the world. The card/app should be useable anonymously (no data misuse possible) and customers using the card should be given a real reward at the shop where they collected points. Furthermore should it be possible to support local charity organisation by donating points. Why not entitling someone in need to pick up some fresh vegetables at a local supermarket by simply donating some points? Last but not least, a fair customer card should of course send newsletters and coupons, but please just send people stuff they really need and like. In total, we think treating people fairly will result in a good return rate of the card, which is than good for shops. So far, we are proud to having realised a first prototype and also sold some license of our system. Approx. 70% of the distributed cards (6.000) are used on a daily basis. We call that a good start for a loyalty system., However, it does not mean that our system cannot be extended. Although the entire system is designed for stationary shops, we solely use internet and web technologies. This is a perfect match to integrate FIWARE components to make our vision of the most honest loyalty card in the world even more realistic. This loyalty card with a strong charity component brings people closer. We therefore consider us a project within Ã¢\u20acÅSmart CitiesÃ¢\u20acï¿½.

We aim for the broadest possible market and we will only use technologies that are available to the majority of mobile device users.Â , , Â , , We have already developed our first game, Hidden Heroes, that is now in soft launch. The game is based on barcode and QR code scanning: Players scan products, receive a land and fight for the ownership of the products. This first game has validated our platform, and helps us to start understanding player behaviour in the real world. The product is primarily aimed at 13-39 year old male audience and the game sessions range from around a minute to tens of minutes. We want to broaden the audience and aim for much shorter game sessions and a more broad audience., , Â , , In the CreatiFI project we want to develop PetSpot, our next game in planning, that is aimed at everyone aged 9 and up. It is a no barrier to entry Mixed Reality game where the goal of the game is for the real world to adapt the game experience to the player and not requiring the player to do anything., , Â , , Current mobile games answer the basic consumer need to be entertained in the short moments they have available. Mobile games have done a fantastic job in this, but bringing the real world elements to games has not yet taken off. The main reason is the barrier to entry they impose as for example Ingress, the location based game, requires the players to physically go to a location to complete tasks. This is a serious barrier to entry for the players, as the cannot really be picked up anywhere., , Â , , We are creating a unique new product, that does not impose any new barriers to entry. Pet Spot is a simple game of collecting animals from the real world. The game is a mixed reality game, where players can at any point try to spot and catch animals from a fantasy world that is overlapping with ours. The game works as follows (subject to further prototyping next year):, , 1. As players start the game, the game checks what animals roam around this location. There are always the same animals roaming at the same location, so if a player wants to catch a special animal and knows where it has been seen, it is always there. This will allow the game to have viral effects as well - i.e. tell friends that at the Piccadilly Circus there is a lion roaming!, , 2. Players may try to catch an animal with \u201cthe catcher\u201d and they are always awarded with a new animal. Players get the animals based on rarity, so a rarer animal is caught less often., , 3. With the animals, players can engage in fun activities, that will be protyped in the first phase of the project and further defined throughout the lifetime of the product., , Â , , The product is a mobile game that is made available in application store(s), and a game service running the game world. The product offers true differentiation and innovation in an era where most mobile games fiercely copy each other!, , Â , , The core business of PetSpot is two fold., , First, the game is a free to play game that is aimed at a wide target audience. We want to entertain players where ever they are and always offer an interesting snack of a game!, , Second, the interaction with the real world offers a very large opportunity to tie in the brands and advertisement in a totally new way. To make this effective, we need to first gather a large number of players into the game.

We will also put our own cameras if we want to fill in the gaps.  The information will be available via an API , website and APP., , Why did we take this super simple approach?, The current market is super complicated and dominated by solutions involving sensors buried in the ground linked to traffic management systems. On one hand this is logical because City wide problems have always been viewed from an industrial viewpoint solved by industrial partners., But this is a different era. Simplification of hardware solutions has encouraged a community of makers to innovate using low cost components typified by the Arduino and raspberry-pi, and to raise funds independently using crowd-funding., , The ParkShark Street cam is a fully thought through solution which uses Computer Vision to make a smart prediction of parking space availability in urban areas.   The algorithm will be kept a trade secret but the method could be used to enhance any situation where a vehicle or fleet of vehicles needs to park in areas of limited availability such as Urban delivery places or areas designated for overnight sleeping for truck drivers., , We  have also applied the same technology to drop off availability for touring busses and delivery waiting areas for local shop owners., , At this stage we need to build a cloud based management platform which can also be open source and downloadable.  After evaluating FI-WARE we believe that by using FI-WARE components to build the system we can gain an advantage when selling to Euopean cities as the software should be accepted by all stakeholders and potential cities.

Duplica3ons and outdated phone numbers, e-Â­?mails, addresses, etc. are common, specifically for contacts not used regularly. The pain of manually having to update a contact card or not having the contact information when needed, is one which is currently solved by searching Facebook, LinkedIn, Yellow Pages or even by contacting a mutual acquaintance for a phone number or email. This happens even if that information is, or should be, available to the person searching for the number or email in the first place. With Onetact we want to create a new synchronised and connected contact book, making sure our users always have the right contact informa3on for all of their contacts in their contact book, automatically. By gathering data from sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, OpenCorporates , Yellow Pages and at the same time crowdsourcing data from our users, we create a new database of Master ID\u2019s for all individuals and companies that we get exposed to. These Master ID\u2019s will be built by gathering data from all available data sources and with the help of data process workers from India and ever expanding machine learning algorithms.

Although monitoring is already widely used in high voltage (HV) transmission grids, there is presently very limited monitoring of low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) distribution systems because of their huge extent which makes the cost of applying conventional HV monitoring techniques prohibitive. Our monitoring solution would allow the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to detect violations of system operating limits in real?time and, therefore, to plan and operate their systems much more safely and effectively and to integrate higher volumes of distributed energy resources (DERs) at the distribution level. Gridhound\u2019s novel approach to grid monitoring is based on the concept of using data that is not directly associated with the grid topology. The question of data protection does not arise as the data used is abstract and its physical relation to the grid is known only to the DSO. Gridhound can perform grid voltage estimation with very few measurements, but with increasing accuracy as more measurements become available. This allows it to be gradually adopted by a DSO: as the DSO gains confidence in the product, they can provide more input measurement data and get an improved grid estimation. The project will develop a product called Grid Monitoring Unit (GMU) as a cloud?based application, based on FIWARE GEs and DSEs and using open weather and geographical data.

Over time, ProtoPixel strengthened its expertise towards Interactive Lighting Design (ILD), an emergent field that combines lighting engineering and interaction design with the aim of creating expressive and dynamic media content for luminic surfaces. In a way, it is all about manipulating and controlling light in a creative manner, as something more than switching bulbs on and off. , , Â , , Through an extended ILD practice, ProtoPixel developed a deep expertise in different aspects of ILD services, and became deeply aware of the needs that currently affect the field, as the lack of prototyping tools, the need of frameworks for content and interface development, cross-platforms solutions, compatibility with current industrial standards, among others., , Â , , Fed by this industrial experience, Protopixel has started to develop ProtoLight, a product that will bridge the current creative and engineering gaps that exist between lighting and interaction design. In short, ProtoLight is a plug &amp; play hardware and software framework that allows to create any type of lighting surface (from large scale media facades to wearable displays) out of most commercially available luminic artifacts (i.e. LEDs strips) and display media content that can be controlled in real time by different input methods, from mobile phones, to motion and wearable sensors, cameras, data from the internet, etc. With ProtoLight, designers can create highly expressive content without the need of learning specific programming skills, but at the same time, ILD engineers and developers will also find it compatible with current technical standards, which makes ProtoLight a perfect fit for existing ILD setting.

SCEPA, Smart City Energy Performance Analysis, is a set of  tools to identify key indicators of energy efficiency of city assets (lighting, public administrative buildings, Hospitals, Schools, etc). The goal is to build a set of tools for energy asset definition, with all related variables, categorization and analysis and visualization tools that will allow an easy way to rank the efficiency level of each asset in all categories and subcategories to which the asset belongs., The system should allow data standardization in order to facilitate the work with them and then provide a comparison of the energy efficiency of different categories based on the results., , Finally, the possibility of ranking entities in a simple and visually way will allow to recognize (public ranking, annual awards...) who have objectively improved their energy efficiency.

At the same time the globalized market and the arrival of web marketers have created the need and demand for such tools. What it is needed is a CMLS that takes into consideration the new devices and content standards such as the wearable devices and UltraHD content. This increases a lot the creative possibilities in publishing contents., , Â , , The subject of the project is a construction of a CMS / LMS (Content / Learning Management System Software) capable of interfacing with wearable devices that are now on the market, with the use of Ultra HD video projections combined with low budget holographic projection., , Â , , The project of the drivers for wearable devices must provide the creation of image recognition routines, for this is expected in the business plan the presence of an experienced programmer., , Â , , By analyzing what happens in the market, while on the one hand the management and content production is having preponderance towards the development of the hardware, and the concepts of information, training and promotion intersect with the use of new media, the development of the LMS softwares remained related of the university/academic approach, dedicated to the satisfaction of administrative needs (classrooms and user management, exams and so on), or facilitated authoring for teachers, that are not interested in acquiring multimedia instruction design skills, so often flatten the content of the online training in textual collections, or PDF file to download., , Â , , It is surprising that even the newest EDX platform, despite the large universities inside as member of the EDX Committee (MIT, Stanford, etc.), seems decidedly not innovative. In our opinion, the real EDX orientation is to impose a standard of worldwide distribution of content (known as MOOC), to impose a standard training, such as YouTube for general purpose videos., , , This surprisingly slow approach still applies even for corporate academies. Quite rarelyÂ  companies are aware of the importance of training to better sell their products or services, and invest seriously in content production., , Â , , The trend however is slowly evolving, driven by the arrival of new personal devices., , Our project has the goal to create something differenciated of what is on the market at the moment, interfacing wearable devices of various kinds with a CMS / LMS that provides, finally, tools for their use., Obviously, the development of a custom module cannot be exclusive (it is difficult to think of replacing all existing CMS/LMS), and therefore should again be open towards various sources and display instruments, such as:, - proprietary and open source LMS of international relevance, - Wearables devices from different vendors, - UHD screens from different vendors, - Low budget Holographic projection etc., , Therefore the investment in development is not only in the direction of central code but also of plugins and drivers for various devices.

Wearables such as Smart Watches, Smart Wristbands and Google Glasses have already interesting applications, but there is a big room for innovation for the end user. We believe that wearables will become mainstream and we want to build a software solution for it. Wearables and Smartphones generate multimedia and sensor data.  We want to build an new generation application that enables users to share this data not just with friends, but also with their communities and open data portals. Our focus will be on user data privacy and security. With our application users will be the only ones who decide which data to share and with whom., For developing our Android based application we will use the FIWARE. This platform is useful for this project because it provides an open and free framework with specific tools for the backend of our application.

Whether it is about a sight in a city we just visited or on our night out, we always want to know where crowds and our friends are located or have the tendency to go to, during both day and night, every single day of the week. The answer to this question can help us decide effectively, based on additional parameters, such as our mood and our location. SPELL is a freemium, cross-platform mobile application, able to provide dynamic, real-time information and updates to users, businesses and public service providers about points of interest that attract people. Furthermore, it also has the ability to predict the crowd density at a given location on a given date. In order to realise this, SPELL will gather and analyse open big data that correlate to a city and its citizens. This data will be collected from the application itself, social media (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Gowalla etc.) as well as additional dynamic sources of public information. Moreover, in its backbone analysis, data deriving from weather forecasts about a given location will be correlated. The users of our mobile application will simply \"\"cast a SPELL\"\" and will be presented with automated answers on questions such as: Where are the crowds? How many people are in this event? Where are my friends? Where do people usually go on a Saturday night out? In future versions of SPELL the application will be able to provide real-time information about the crowd density at a given location to public service providers, such as the Police and the Fire Department. An important concern of SPELL is the protection of user privacy, based on, but not limited to, a series of anonymisation techniques during data processing. SPELL system's architecture and user interfaces will be based on the FIWARE OpenStack-based cloud hosting capabilities and its rich library of components (e.g. for big data analytics). \" "},{"id_internal":"3aa06e45-0975-4dcc-9b9d-c94a43213c84","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"CEED Tech","Q1_3":"moow.farm Kft.","Q1_4":"Moow Rumen Bolus","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"A","Q1_7":"4.00","Q1_8":"2.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"B","Q1_12":"Data Viz - SpagoBI,IoT Broker","Q1_13":"30000.00","Q1_16":"1.00","Q2_1":"TRL5","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"A","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"B","Q3_2a":"20.00","Q3_2b":"30.00","Q3_2d":"50.00","Q3_3a":"B","Q3_4":"F","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2017","Q3_7":"A","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"B","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"B","Q3_12":"Environment and Nature","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"20.00","Q4_3b":"30.00","Q4_3c":"40.00","Q4_3d":"50.00","Q4_4":"A","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"50.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING, EDUCATION, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEFENCE; COMPULSORY SOCIAL SECURITY","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"X","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"X","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"X","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Hardware","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Services Operations Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Operations and Manufacturing Applications","SME_STARTUP":"Startup","full_text":"Our product is developed for the dairy cattle segment in agriculture.

Unfortunately, if we could get those answers, they would probably have a high impact in our lives. For instance, what if you could instantly know which is the best neighborhood to buy a property? Which is the best school for your kids? Where you should open a restaurant/business? These are perfectly reasonable questions that might be difficult or even impossible to answer in the majority of cities nowadays. The good news is that every day the amount of open data and its availability is growing. This data, by itself or combined with other privately held information, can help get some of these questions answered. But, raw data is almost always humanly impossible to understand and reason about without the support of analytic tools.  But, although systems for mining information are traditionally very powerful, they are also complex, hard to use and expensive. \u201cMobilize\u201d aims to democratize the access to powerful analytical tools to the common person and open a world of intelligence to everyone in a plain manner. \u201cMobilize\u201d introduces a disruptive business model to the area of Analytics and a simple and intuitive way of creating analysis and distributing knowledge. Our product provides the algorithms and infrastructure for mining data and presenting results in clear and intuitive manner. Our clients can integrate Mobilize\u2019s analysis into their own platforms seamlessly, thus simplifying the dissemination of information. The focus of this product is not on technology, since FIWARE already provides all the technological support we need for the project, it is on the way the system will be used, become accessible to different types of users, potentiate the building and distribution of information, in a model \u201cfrom users to users\u201d, and how it will be monetized.

Owners of 3D-printers will profit from the accessible network through an increase of 3D print-job requests, a balanced workload and an optimized flow rate. End-users, on the other side, will benefit from time and cost savings and can furthermore request their 3D print-outs on the go (mobile) and nearby. , Our existing start-up company REVOPRINT itself is an expert for the establishment of such distributed networks to ensure a win-win value chain. As of today REVOPRINT runs a print shop platform with access to over 90 print-shops in 43 cities. These print shops have a strong interest in offering a 3D-printing service in addition to their regular portfolio. With our database of over 1500 print shops, REVOPRINT has the ability to implement 3D-printing in a huge market and could internationalize the topic throughout Europe., Technically speaking, the challenge is to synchronize and build up interfaces for the variety of 3D-printer models and their unique functionalities, e.g. use of materials, multi-color printing, printing speed etc. Furthermore, it is important to make them accessible through the web so that workload and workflow can become automatized., Therefore, the technical innovation has two sides: automatized 3D print-queuing in a distributed network and on the other side price calculation based on the 3D print file data and further varying factors. , For the development of the platform, a wide range of FIWARE technologies comes in handy. These include:, \u2022Collaborative 3D Web Viewer, \u20223D Scan, \u2022Collaborative Asset Management, \u2022Secure Event Management , \u2022SEMed, With the complementary skills and backgrounds of the team members, we have the potential to revolutionize the 3D-printing market and leverage 3D-printing towards a new era of digital manufacturing with the 3D-REVOPRINT platform.

In this sense 3DSquare points directly to the sectors (automotive, consumer products, medical\u2026) that in the coming years will be introducing 3D printing and will need robust and traceable processes to assure the dimensional quality of their manufactured goods. Limitations of the 3D printing process derive in the need of post-printed machining to achieve the required dimensional quality. So, TRIMEK, by 3DSquare project, aims to open a new service to the 3D printing sector integrating 3D optical scanning and certified measuring software with FI based enablers to continuously increase the printing quality reducing the machining phase. Firstly, 3D Scanning will digitalise of the entire surface of the printed part. Then, M3 software process the data, reporting the comparison of the real part with the CAD model envisioned and building deviation maps. Afterwards, information will be exploited in to create correlation program (at printing and CAD model level) that loops feedback to improve constantly the printing quality. If needed, this information will be used to drive the final machining phase. To achieve these, TRIMEK will exploit FIWARE web and cloud technologies. 3DScan, 3DCWV offers the possibility of visualizing the 3D digitalized parts. DinamicCEP processes the data to provide correlation results. Object Storage gives the opportunity to store the files generated by the digitalization of the printed objects in appropriate containers in the cloud. Finally, IdentityManager KeyRock provides security to the whole system with authentication. In conclusion, 3DSquare wants to generate a new TRIMEK service including in the 3D Printing world the most advanced dimensional quality control methods used nowadays in the industrial sector, with the objective of improving the final quality of printed objects, as well as increasing the control and the traceability of the whole process.

It will eliminate the transaction inefficiencies in the traditional trade process of Solar Power Purchase Agreements (SPPA) and Solar Leases (SL), enabling a win-win condition both for Solar Services Providers and for Rooftop Owners. , SPPA and SL are contracts between a Ã¢\u20acÅSolar Services ProviderÃ¢\u20acï¿½ who owns, utilizes, and maintains the photovoltaic project, and a Ã¢\u20acÅRooftop OwnerÃ¢\u20acï¿½ who delivers a designated location for the solar installation such as an unutilized rooftop.  , In a SPPA, the Rooftop Owner agrees to purchase the energy output from the developer at a fixed price for a prearranged time period. In a Solar Lease, instead, the Rooftop Owner rents the solar equipment against a monthly remittance. In either cases, the Rooftop Owner is able to slash down his energy expenses drastically and notice long-term savings as current grid-electricity prices continue to increase. The Solar Services Provider pays for all the installation costs and is held responsible for the operation and maintenance of the project., With SunnyRev, Rooftop Owners will be able to minimize the solar rate and maximize their savings by putting Producers in competition for their rooftops with a reverse auction mechanism. Bidding performed in real-time via the Internet will result in a dynamic, competitive process. This will help achieve rapid downward price pressure (energy price or lease remittance, depending of the case)  that is not normally attainable using traditional static paper-based bidding processes. At the same time, Producers will reduce costs and timing for acquiring new clients.

Financial information on SMEs is hard to get. Next to this, information is usually out-dated, biased and time consuming to analyse. This often creates a higher risk and makes it too expensive for an investor or financier to invest in those SME companies. Suppose someone is investing: getting information after the investment is done is even more time consuming as it has to be done on a regular base. This makes it difficult for SMEs to convince investors and financiers. The solution we offer is to provide all the stakeholders (entrepreneur, bank, investor, advisor, accountant) with up-to?date and automated information on the SME. This decreases workload and lowers the risk for banks and investors which makes it easier to invest or finance SMEs. After the investment is done, information will be also provided in a fully automated way. We extract information from services that are already use by entrepreneurs, so no extra hassle. Think about accounting packages (+600 accountancy packages) and other web services used by the company, so it is probably best to describe us a \u2018Geckoboard for investors and financiers\u2019. Sparkholder has developed several analytical algorithms as well as several banking models (rating model and default model). In two cases with big Dutch banks we predicted a default of one of their clients months before their own systems did. With the Finodex project we want to enrich the company specific data with free available \u2018open data\u2019, so we can regress the available information and make comparisons. Reusing information from these sources will improve the quality of our platform and will increase predictability for investors/financiers.

As result of that, the technological platform will be able to automatically set the parameters on the minimum number of seats to be sold in every event. Therefore establishing the possibility for an event to be carried out without any financial risk to any of the parties., , With the FIWARE enablers we will be able to create visualizations for the \u201ccontent rights holders\u201d (independent film makers, distribution companies) in order to simplify complex data and find better strategies of distribution for their content and a more satisfied end client that could have access to movies he likes.

It aims at improving game quality (less bugs) and fun and at optimizing sales. All these taken together shall greatly boost developer financial sustainability.Â , , Â , , With Links2Gamer, developers are fully secured for sharing their Work-In-Progress release and to speed up the release date of their game, with bug-free and enriched releases. Links2Gamers delivers to small independant developers a more-than-equivalent solution that only a very few major game publishers have developed internally. Actually, it brings extra fonctionalities brought by our total embedded security. Security means that they have much more manoeuvre to create their game traction, have the game tested by their community.Â For an independant game developer, visibility of its game is the master word. Links2Gamer is the best tool to enhance it. Links2Gamer enables to feed the community around the game (from crowd-funders, free testers, early access volonteers, ...) with Work-In-Progress releases without limitation ( (no need to make a brided version) since our security is total.

Therefore besides the parking space providers in the different sectors, we also have consumers that vary according to the sectors.  According to the description of consumer markets categories, we would place ourselves into the smart parking category, therefore transport and logistics. Not 100% sure how to answer this question, as the consumer market could be horizontal as well, but mostly transport and logistics based on the previous explanation. SPPeX provides an effective means to town centre visitors to: plan or instantaneously find the most suitable parking spaces in the city; allow to make guaranteed bookings; automate the entire process such as payment on their smart phone. Key strengths are that it provides parking operators with an integrated solution that monitors the usage of parking spaces and the identity of customers to manage parking operation parameters in real-time in a secure cloud-based back-end, and user friendly interfaces to the parking managers and customers.

In short: we do Corporate Design for the Ear. Our work is closely linked to an extensive archive, filled with tagged music files ranging from little known underground tracks to mainstream hits. Our idea is to make this archive accessible to our brand clients with a closed platform named PLAYERMAKER, offering scalable services for 3 major scenarios. Thus brands will be allowed to present music in a clearly defined way to dedicated customer groups - think of Soundcloud with a dedicated business-to-business use., , Â , , One might immediately have the impression that such services already exist in abundance. However the very opposite is true, since all current applications (Spotify etc) had been developed for end consumers. Companies at the backend though completely lack means to control the actual distribution of music. To date no commercial application is available, which offers to businesses eg. one of the following 3 services:, , allow for a specified number of free downloads of tracks (eg. first 666 for a gothic album),  offer novel/niche music we hold valid licenses for, but which are not yet licensed by the cloud service itself and are hence systematically blocked,  offer dedicated 24h radio program as promotional gift to business clients instead of the usual ashtrays/umbrellas (eg. \u2018Lavazza Radio\u2019 for coffee bars), Soundcloud offers single track / playlists sharing, Deezer and Spotify enable continuous streams. Our past cooperations with these well-established platforms though proved their inadequacy for sophisticated services for the above reasons. Our envisioned platform specifically aims at business to business use, the focus is on a creative agency\u2019s needs to overcome such restrictions., , Â , , Target Market, We particularly want to enhance and improve typical business cases like the following for brands using music in marketing activities:, , Selecting music for clients that they can licence for their video productions. We call this use \u201cCompilation Player\u201d.,  Supplying clients with reviews of record releases or interviews, supplemented by a stream and/or download of a song. We call this use \u201cEmbedding Player\u201d.,  Selling to our clients a 24h streaming radio which they can offer as a sponsored marketing tool to various outlets. We call this use \u201cRadio Player\u201d. (cf. 4.1), Advantages / Business Model, Commercial advantages on several levels:, , Â , , Immediate: Saving time resources, , Undue portions of working time no longer \u2018wasted\u2019 by disproving copyright infringement claims from Soundcloud for tracks legally licenced by us,  Smoothening of workflows, Â , , Near future: Decisive product portfolio expansion, , Advanced streaming service functionalities,  Ability to deliver fresh, little known content (eg \u2018new releases radio\u2019),  Deliver to shop owners a ready-made, emotionally engaging radio program without repetition, geared to their target group,  Sell this service to brands that sponsor it to be used by smaller outlets (eg. beer brewery can sponsor a \u201cBeer Radio\u201d for bars), In contrast to Spotify\u2019s new \u201cSoundtrack Your Brand\u201d approach our service will not rely on the small portion of music-savvy shop/bar owners, but will address the majority, who are no music specialists. We will concentrate on this main use case to explain our sales strategy and evaluate challenges and risks (5.4)., , Â , , Future: Licensing, , Grant platform access to other audio branding agencies and editorial teams,  Sell a package license of the platform to be installed on their cloud servers "},{"id_internal":"f2aea585-b86b-4791-a402-72beadf7b20e","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FABulous","Q1_2":"Hungary","Q1_3":"FabrikÃ¡ciÃ³s LaboratÃ³rium Kft.","Q1_4":"3DLIVE","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"6.00","Q1_8":"2.00","Q1_9":"222580.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Synchronization,Protocol Adapter,3D-UI-XML3D","Q1_13":"18000.00","Q1_16":"4.00","Q2_1":"TRL4","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"B","Q3_2a":"20.00","Q3_2b":"20.00","Q3_2c":"60.00","Q3_4":"D","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"B","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"B","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"30.00","Q4_3b":"50.00","Q4_3c":"90.00","Q4_3d":"100.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"0.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer DIY/design, MANUFACTURING","B2B_B2C":"B2B/B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"X","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"X","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Output Management Tools","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"System Infrastructure Software","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"System Management Software","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"We would like to develop a network based collaborative manufacturing service and community for 3D printing large individual objects to support art, design architecture, industry, NGO\u2019s and social programs.

Our aim is to create a bottom up network of owners of the 3D printers to team up to create a real creative industrial community., , Our innovative approach would increase the maximum size of the print and reduce the manufacturing time by using a distributed grid of 3D printers, which would each print only one small part of the big object.

The backend of the service would run cloud based computing capacity, which would do all the calculations necessary for the slicing of the object, creating the connectivity of the parts, and generating the work path of each printer. A common goal to solve a single task using resources in a better way. The service concept includes a logistical module, which is responsible for planning and tracking the shipment of each printed part, where project owners could follow the process and a shipping company would be involved as a partner.

While more and more people learn about the idea that open data can be used to streamline government services and to solve social problems, it is difficult to find successful use cases and realized projects. DataLook changes that. At its core DataLook provides the web site datalook.io which allows people to share and discuss data-driven projects for social good. We create a platform that enables people to get inspired by innovative and useful projects from around the world. The vision is that our users eventually replicate these projects in their own community and bring the idea of Smart Cities to life., Going beyond open data DataLook also showcases projects that have used closed data to solve hard problems for the greater good. Some of these projects have even contributed to saving lives and it makes therefore sense to include them and to inspire the open data community. DataLook approaches people with different backgrounds, while all are stakeholders of Smart Cities. On the one hand programmers and data scientists who realize data-driven projects from a technical point of view. But also representatives from the government and NGO sector who have deep domain expertise and who can work with the technical people to identify problems that can be solved with data. Journalists and researchers also find inspiration for their work on DataLook., In this proposal we describe how FIWARE can help us to reach important milestones for the project. Specifically, we build an interactive map showing the location of projects together with metadata. CKAN integration allows users to store and find data sets related to the projects. Eventually, we will organize a hackathon that is live broadcasted using FIWARE technology. This allows us to broadcast hands-on examples how data can be used for social good to the FIWARE community and beyond. Possibilities to monetize our services are also described in the proposal.

The solution provides product teams an app library that they can just plug into their app and capture the user's screen, the interactions with the app and the end user behind the screen using the front-facing camera of the smartphone, tablet or even laptop. Product teams don't have to setup an expensive usability lab anymore with specialized hard- and software, which is also very intrusive to use by the user. See usability lab of Center of User Experience Design in Leuven., , Â , , The product team of the app can just follow remotely in real-time what the user is doing with the app, where they encounter problems and how they feel about the app just by looking at their facial expressions and their verbal and body language. Product teams can remotely follow what their users are doing on the screen, hear what they are saying and even see their reactions. In the meanwhile they can make notes that are added to the video stream which will help them at a later time e.g. to replay problematic parts of the session to better understand what happened and how they could eventually improve the design of the app. The product team members who are observing can even use chat to discus or even consult with each other what is going on. When they want they can even use the voice channel to interact with the user to even better understand why she is using the app the way she does or can even help her when she is completely stuck in the app and does not even know anymore what to do., , Â , , Every session will be recorded and made ready for replay afterwards, not only showing the recorded screen and audio and video but also visualizing the different interactions and problems the user encountered during the session as well as the notes the observers made while following., , Â , , Even after all usability tests are performed and the app is put into production, the service could still be used by the customer service department to interact with users who have problems with the app. When users need help they could start the service itself which will contact customer service and the user could show customer service what they are trying to do with the app and where they have problems are get stuck. Customer service on their side can just see in their web browser the screencast of what the user is doing with app and in the meanwhile hear the users explanation and see their facial expressions. Customer service can then just use the audio channel to guide the user through the app., , Â , , UXprobe would like to add this concept to their current user experience analytics offering. There is already a lot of interesting insights we are getting from our analytics service that is absolutely indispensible. But really seeing and hearing users struggle with an app is of an enormous value to convince developers and other stakeholders that a redesign of a specific part of the app is really necessary and worthwhile.

This gap is going to result from the introduction of ICT products in an unbalanced manner. If these products are not simple and cheap enough, only a fraction of the farmers are going to adopt them, leaving the rest in inferior conditions. The solution is the simplest precision agriculture kit, from the sensor to the report. This is probably the first step of the farmer on precision agriculture, so we want to keep it simple and cheap. Use case: A farmer connects to the platform and register for the product because a colleague was talking about it. The web is straightforward and asks for basic questions. The platform determines that for this case, the best value indicator is \u2018water consumption\u2019 and presents the price of the \u2018smart meter\u2019 along with a return of investment prediction (based on real use cases). Once the kit is bought and installed, the farmer can use the mobile application with a simple three colour interface (green, yellow, red) and prevent water losses because of the alarms and advices received. The impact of this kind of platform is: a) Social: Empowers small farmers and gather statistics to improve overall region performance b) Environmental: Helps to adjust the amount of phytosanitary and fertilizer products. Tracks water misuse c) Economic: Increases production and cut costs on products and water The Business model is based on selling devices with a one-year platform subscription.

Our drones clean the panels without precious fresh water, that is wasted today. Since we are first with this invention, we have a strong set of intellectual property and will both license the technology but also work on generating own sales.  Solar panels suffer energy production because of dirt on solar panels. Studies report losses of up to 35% per month in energy  because of sand and dust on solar panels, and even up to 80% after a sandstorm.  Their manufacturers are looking for cleaning technologies as operators and servicing companies clean their power plants manually, in some parts of the world, almost on a daily basis.

To feed this requirement, more and more data centres are built. The main resource these centres need is electric power. Servers or computers need electric power in order to work. Over 99% of the electric power used by a server will be converted to heat. It has to be absorbed by or discharged into the environment. This process requires artificial cooling circles like air-radiators or fluid-cooling-systems. These cooling-systems also need electric power to work. A study showed that approximately 1/3 of the electric power resource for a modern and energy-efficient data centre is used for cooling systems for servers., The project cloudheizung aims to re-use the produced heat. Instead of Ã¢\u20acÅdestroyingÃ¢\u20acï¿½ the heat with cooling systems, we use innovative heat exchanging system to convert it into heating energy which can be used for office or civilian buildings. Our concept is to establish multiple mini data centre locations based on the need for heating energy.

Our goal is to change that by developing an affordable, internet-connected device and a web application which gives end users insight into and advice about their energy consumption., , Recent developments in hardware allow us to build a solution that is independent from a base station, has fewer components than existing devices and uses the ubiquitous 802.11n protocol, thus being significantly cheaper and easier to set up than what is available now., , The product consists of an internet-connected electricity meter socket (Ã¢\u20acÅsmart meter socketÃ¢\u20acï¿½) for monitoring, a web platform and API for analysis and management. In contrast to traditional meters or common smart meters, one device monitors the consumption of single electricity consumer rather than the whole household., , For the scope of this project we focus on the development, production and distribution of pilot production run of 400 devices plus the corresponding web application.

With our app it will be easy to move around by choosing what matter for us for experiencing the best of these active ways of urban mobility., Our app maps, rates and gives routing suggestions about the pedestrian-bikers-friendliness of streets and places in urban areas.The app is not a simple navigator that takes you from A to B, calculating the shortest distance, but is a powerful and disruptive tool that will change the way of calculating route., , To do so, we combine structural information about the streets (like type of streets, presence of pavements or cycle lanes, crosslights, speed limits and so on) with Environmental indexes, Open and Crowdsourced data. The benefit expected are not only in terms of wellbeing of the users or reduced pollution but also more awareness about own neighbourhood, increase of social interactions and growth of local economy., , The app can be very important for asmathics, children, pollen allergics.

The latter will include different benefits for businesses such as advanced security (e.g. hosting on own servers) and analytics (e.g. identification of experts among co-workers). Freemium is a proven business model for SaaS solutions. We expect revenues from open beta onwards (see financial plan). However, we do not expect to break even before 2017., , Â , , Our target audience contains customers and users. We have identified SMBs (e.g. Startups) using modern web apps like Gmail, Salesforce and Dropbox as our initial group of customers. In fact, such customers have proven to be willing to invest in solutions that make their employees more productive. Knowledge workers (e.g. sales reps) within such businesses are our target users.

The system should be directly usable by logistic companies as a safe monitoring tool for their containers. Sea and dry ports as well as custom authorities will also benefit from automating processes related to containers transport.

Thanks to the new energy laws in europe, the energy suppliers are forced to offer new technologies to save energy. Our software fits for this purpose. Like I explained in the previous chapter Companies often underestimate the effort of implementing sophisticated IoT technologies and decide to do it by themselves. This results in considerably higher expenditure and longer development time. , With the service of guh, time to market can be reduced significantly. Based on guhIO we offer conceptual designs and product development. Plugins and interface layouts allow the rapid integration of desired functionality., guhIO eases development and support. Unfortunately, there is no general standard for connected things. To be future-proof, an adaptable platform is unavoidable., guhIO unifies key-technologies for IoT products: guhIO is extendable easily; guhIO speaks various machine languages; guhIO receives continuous upgrades. This improves customer retention; , App-Templates allow quick UI customization; Connection to social-media-platforms; Connection to cloud services ., guhIO acts similarly to an operating system. It manages surrounding IoT devices and supports many M2M communication methods.

The MVMANT platform allows the deployment of a fleet of vehicles circulating on fixed routes (like a bus) with a service on request (like a taxi). The dispatching of vehicles is managed through predictive algorithms and advanced machine learning techniques. Cities are struggling with traffic and parking issues, a consequence of the need for personal car due to insufficient coverage and inconvenience of the existing public transportation. Local administrations are forced to find a cost effective solution to meet the targets outlined by the White Paper on Transport and comply with air pollution limits. The EU Commission has launched legal proceedings against several European cities (23 in Germany) which have violated repeatedly air pollution limits and in many cases car traffic has been limited or completely blocked. Those targets are only achievable by fostering the paradigm of Mobility as a Service, with a convenient user-centric door-to-door car-independent lifestyle, which increases mobility of all citizens and drastically reduces the number of circulating vehicles. MVMANT is a novel mobility platform  that enables the deployment of a fleet of clean vehicles circulating on fixed routes with adaptive and predictive dispatching. This means that vehicles will be available when and where needed., The aim is to fill the gap between expensive but fully personalized taxi service and cheaper but not flexible public transportation, in order to enable full transport multimodality. , Our platform offers a pay-per-use travel experience, employs gamification to incentivise mobility behaviour change (virtual travel units, loyalty schemes), and leverages in-vehicle and on-station entertainment and infotainment for targeted advertising. The competitive advantage towards services like Uber is that MVMANT cooperates with incumbent PT companies, offering them a top-notch platform as a service to introduce this novel transportation mode, compliant with existing regulations. The advantage over carsharing is that customers have to drive themselves; cars have to be parked in a public space and subtract valuable areas that could be dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists; cars stand idle most of the time and are not always available where and when needed; check-in and check-out procedures take time and increase the real cost of the service. , MVMANT embeds an incentive and loyalty platform based on trip units, that benefits all stakeholders in the urban ecosystem, including small businesses in the city centerÂ : e.g. a store can offer free travel units to customers; the municipality can award travel units to citizen who recycle waste. This will further reduce the price of the service, stimulating a virtual cycle of increased usage, revenues for the PT and for the platform provider. The end users of this transportation mode are city dwellers that need a reliable, convenient and comfortable door-to-door mobility without owning and/or using a car. MVMANT offers the complete enabling platform as a service and takes a commission on the trip units sold, as well on the advertising/incentive scheme. ,  See above.

The solution is dedicated for public bus drivers and companies as well as lorries drivers and companies that operate on the streets of EU cities. The solution will be composed of a miniaturized SiGe BiCMOS integrated radar front end, antenna and processing electronics on the hardware side, that will be mounted on a vehicle and scan the sides of the bus/lorry to discover bicycle riders that could be otherwise not identified by the driver. The signal from the radar will be fed to a smartphone/tablet or other display that will run a dedicated app, which will notify the driver visually and by sound that a bicycle rider has been discovered. The app will be connected to internet and the information will be merged with Google maps or alike for enhanced presentation. The app will also keep track of the identified bicycle riders, their position and how they move relative to the vehicle for tracking in case of incidents. The aim of the project is to design and prototype such an application that will accompany SIRC radar. The solution will enhance safety of bicycle riders on the streets as their numbers are increasing in the EU cities. The solution will contribute directly towards lowering incident numbers between bicycle riders and vehicles and will make EU cities much more friendly towards bicycle riders.

According to several studies, the first three hours after the child goes missing are the most crucial in finding the child safely. At the same time, 1 in 3 pets get lost at least once in their lifetimes, 90% of which are never found or returned. There currently aren\u2019t any tracking systems in the market that can adequately respond to those situation\u2019s needs \u2013 either because of the short obtainable range (Bluetooth) or the high associated monthly cost (GSM)., Enter Findster, the innovative tracking system without monthly fees (available in two different versions - Findster Kids and Findster Pets). At the center of Findster\u2019s ecosystem is the wireless communication established between a child/pet module and a guardian module, obtained through our proprietary RF protocol. It allows us to achieve a longer range with reduced costs, hence the absence of any monthly fees. , Real time monitoring, the creation of security zones and push notifications are some of the features accessible through Findster's mobile app. Using another component (the Basestation) it is possible to further extend the system\u2019s range, as well as to connect it to wi-fi networks and to the Cloud \u2013 making Findster even more omnipresent.

Thanks to next generation sequencing technologies (NGS), nowadays huge amounts of genomic data are being generated. However, the two new challenges are to manage this huge amount of data, and to provide a quality curation process to extract information valuable for research and diagnosis. , By using our innovative Genomic Information Cognitive System, we are able to select the \u201cright data\u201d out from the current genomic data chaos, and by using end-user oriented interfaces we support the physicians, geneticists and bioinformatics in their decision making processes. GEM Cognitive will shorten decision making times up to 90% (with the associated price reduction) and increase the quality of this process by integrating the key data sources (both open and private), selecting the relevant data, integrating research literature and learning from previous decisions made. This environment will also be the core of an advanced training program for academia focused on health. GEM Cognitive will initially focus in breast cancer diagnosis, compatibility genetic tests in reproductive medicine clinics and high education training.  In these three areas, we expect a direct impact on: (1) women health and mortality associated to breast cancer, (2) prevention of genetic disorders on new births at fertility clinics, and (3) the quality of the education programs for the future health professionals.,  We have already worked in this sector for the last four years.

There are a lot of tools in the content space, but they suffer from a couple of disadvantages. First, they cover a part of the content space, for example social media, or web, whereas distribution is a multiplatform business. Secondly: data stays in silos, because content and content marketing organisations use a wide variety of tools (social media analytics, web analytics, A-B testing etc) that do not communicate. On top of that there is no grip and real overview because there are no powerful visualisations of content distribution concepts that span across those platforms and silos., , Â , , CleverLions has developed a dashboard Â (name: SmartOcto) that visualises the whole content strategy, multiplatform, and focuses on real impact. It has modules on influencers, scraping, social media and ROI, but can also make use of existing pro tools within a media organisation., , Â , , Important perspectives: the CleverLions dashboard captures the history but focuses on the future. It calculates the momentum of content and gives real time alerts when content has a lot of engagement or virality factor. In that way publishers, broadcasters and content marketeers can influence the impact of their content in realtime or at birth, not when it is at the end of the lifecycle., Secondly: it has a holistic approach on impact. Clients choose their KPI, which could be different than only views, or social media likes. SmartOcto lets media organisations establish the relationship between their content strategy and other business goals, like sales or engagement., , Thirdly: in the coming times it will make the shift from predictive analytics to prescriptive. SmartOcto will calculate the best \u2018moves\u2019 in contentdistribution (\u201cyour audience is in Facebook now, please post this video, it has a high virality factor\u201d) and send out an alert to the right people in the organisation., , Â , , A lot of the unique visualisation concepts in the dashboards (see mockups section) have been validated in the business environment of public broadcasting and are \u2018proven technology\u2019.

Retailers and department stores are some of the entities that actually contribute to this by means of aggressive promotions, loyalty cards, promotional coupons, mailbox marketing, and mailing list advertising. These marketing stunts give families a chance to find the best deals and make the most of their budgets. Unfortunately, they are largely ineffective if people just can\u2019t put the necessary time and effort into it. SmartBY wants to become the leading app for managing and sharing shopping lists among the members of a family and, at the same time, provide a shopping plan to each user for its shopping lists. This plan allows families to have a preview of their overall spending needs and better plan the use of their budget. SmartBY takes into consideration the prices on physical stores, the localization of its users, and the days in which products will be on Sale to create a shopping plan that identifies who, when and where should buy the items on the list in order to maximize savings. Furthermore, SmartBY uses public data to train data mining algorithms to predict how prices will evolve and alert users for perspective raises or drops in prices.

The integrated hospital ward resource planning and management system is a platform operating on two levels \u2013 in the daily medical routine and in hospital performance synthesis/analysis by combining data from various demographic,  healthcare and medical sources to be superimposed on the particular data of the individual medical facility. The main benefits of this approach are: better understanding of cause and effect relationships; optimized supplies and resource planning; reduced supplies wastage; reduction in human error factors; reduced patient handling times; reduced paperwork and administrative burden on qualified medical personnel;  overall reduction of personnel and patient stress due to technical issues. All stakeholders, e.g. medical personnel, patients, suppliers, etc., and elements, e.g. equipment, medical supplies, beds, etc., of the system are assigned UID numbers which monitor their place and role in the various processes. On an operational level, this allows for better process automation and optimization, as well as error prevention. On a management level, seeing the broader picture from own reliable data, all deviations readily stand out and outline rooms for improvement. The real time nature of the data provides shorter intervals for results manifestation of any changes introduced into the system. By synthesizing the bulk of the raw data, reports are generated and benchmarked against other sources or combined with them to generate new insights and value.

These aspects are mutually dependent and complementary. They will use the power of ubiquitous network infrastructure to connect all parts of a city (things) and to transfer data faster, securely and in real time., , When we consider the IoT and the Smart City, the importance of a broadband network becomes apparent. Things of a city will be connected via wireless sensor network and the collected data will be transferred via Wi-Fi or Internet networks to management systems (sink points). The convergence between pervasive sensing and networking is a major challenge. Today, the wireless sensor networks suffer from many limits such as low bandwidth, limited processing power, poor QoS performance (delay, jitter, etc.), etc., , Our project deals with these issues. It aims to ensure the convergence between sensor and broadband networks.  Our solution provides network boxes as intermediary between sensors and their Cloud service providers. Indeed, our VirtuOR boxes offer an easy access between the central \u201csink point\u201d and its applications or data management systems hosted within the Cloud. These boxes help to make \u201csink points\u201d more intelligent, performant and deploy them on-demand as Network Function Virtualisation (NFV). The resources (CPU, memory, etc.) needed by these sink nodes may be adjustable to suit data operations (correlation, mining, analyzing, etc.). Another major benefit of our boxes is to bring the service closer to the sensors. For example, if a sensor needs a monitoring service from the Cloud, it can have locally a virtual instance of this service . A single VirtuOR box could support several \u201csink point\u201d from different providers at the same time. This can help to make decision faster, more accurate, and without wasting network resources. , , ,   "},{"id_internal":"db154ea5-c590-49b0-9c1c-b788ae6591fc","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"IMpaCT","Q1_2":"Spain","Q1_3":"-","Q1_4":"Butano24","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"3.00","Q1_8":"2.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_12":"Configuration Manager-Orion Context Broker,Backend Device Management","Q1_13":"100000.00","Q1_16":"0.00","Q2_1":"TRL8","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"B","Q3_2d":"70.00","Q3_2i":"30.00","Q3_3a":"Q","Q3_4":"F,D","Q3_5":"C","Q3_6":"2019","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"B","Q3_12":"C","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"100.00","Q4_3b":"50.00","Q4_3c":"75.00","Q4_3d":"100.00","Q4_4":"C","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"30.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer energy & home automation, ELECTRICITY, GAS, STEAM AND AIR CONDITIONING SUPPLY","B2B_B2C":"B2B/B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"X","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Inventory Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Supply Chain Management (SCM) Applications","SME_STARTUP":"Group of Entreprens","full_text":"We are targeting the energy sector (domestic LPG) because is a business that needs a clear innovation.

It is a major public health problem,, affecting millions of people worldwide. The primary goal of osteoporosis treatment should be fracture prevention and non-, pharmacological strategies such as diet (mainly calcium, vitamin D and protein) and exercise (weight-bearing exercises that, cause force on the bones like jogging, stair climbing or resistance exercises) that can be modified to maintain bone and muscle, health throughout life., Objectively measured activities using accelerometers are an accurate method for studying relationships between physical, exercise and bone. Recent studies have examined the relationships between levels of vertical impacts associated with exercise, and bone mineral density (BMD) in adolescents or premenopausal women. Taking it together with the fact that the age-related, declines in the intensity and quantity of exercise contribute to the increase in risk of osteoporotic fracture, this lead us to the, necessity to promote physical activity in order to maintain bone mass., The use of technology to enhance exercise prescription and understanding the optimal exercise type and dose (duration,, frequency and intensity) that have the greatest effect on BMD are common issues that arise. Thus, to address these healthcare, needs, sensors can be integrated into wearable technologies and such, so that health information can be acquired in daily living., Therefore, our aim is to develop a system able to acquire health information related to osteoporosis and fragility fractures, prevention, detecting accelerations in different activities and also UVB radiation received (important for vitamin D generation) in, order to implement an application that allows immediate feedback to the users, avoiding the lack of motivation.,  "},{"id_internal":"cdfe22d6-670b-469c-9f6c-8b70de051969","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FINODEX","Q1_3":"SUITE5 Ltd.","Q1_4":"Parkadoro - Easy and Safe City Parking Experience harnessing Real-time Open Data","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"5.00","Q1_8":"2.00","Q1_9":"40000.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Access Control Generic Enabler,Data Viz - SpagoBI,Store,Software Deployment and Configuration,Self-Service Interfaces,Protocol Adapter,POI Data Provider ,Identity Management,GIS Data Provider,Security Monitoring,BigData Analysis","Q1_13":"10000.00","Q1_16":"5.00","Q2_1":"TRL6","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"A","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2b":"60.00","Q3_2f":"30.00","Q3_2h":"10.00","Q3_3a":"P","Q3_4":"F,E,D,B,A","Q3_5":"C","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"B","Q3_12":"H","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"50.00","Q4_3b":"100.00","Q4_3c":"100.00","Q4_3d":"100.00","Q4_4":"C","Q4_5":"C","Q4_6":"80.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"BUSINESS SERVICES, Consumer transport & logistics, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE","B2B_B2C":"B2B/B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"X","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"It is more relevant to the application Accomondation and touristm is relevant to our call Parkadoro aims to help citizens find easy parking spots Parkadoro aims to also target parking garaeg owners Drivers in big city centres are constantly asking themselves the following painful set of questions \u201cWhere can I park quickly?\u201d, \u201cIs that location safe?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the paid alternatives and how much do they cost?\u201d. Parkadoro is an innovative application on both commercial and free parking management that leverages available open datasets related to the parking experience, and answers to these three questions. Parkadoro allows drivers, before or during their trip, to select their destination point and get notified whether it is possible to find a free and safe parking spot, and inform them about paid parking services, presenting the current prices and offers available., Parkadoro offers services to both drivers and commercial users (garage owners, etc.), through the provision of a universal mobile App and of an easy to use backend interfaces, based on an intelligent and adaptive multi-criteria decision support algorithm for suggesting the most efficient parking spots based on both real-time and accumulated open data, driver preferences, as well as community comments., Parkadoro is heavily based on cutting-edge FIWARE enablers and provides services targeting drivers, parking garages owners and also third parties that offer traffic/mobility/automotive related services and products. As such, Parkadoro offers a unique service ecosystem around the daily activity of parking, which is performed by all drivers everyday and if not scheduled appropriately consumes significant time and effort.

Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are undoubtedly the single-most valuable animal pollinators to agriculture because they can be easily maintained and transported to pollinator-dependent crops. It is well documented that 76% of the production of food for human consumption is dependent on the beekeeping sector and 84% of vegetable species cultivated in Europe depend on pollination. Even though sharp regional declines in honey bee populations have occurred in the past, the magnitude and velocity of recent declines are shocking. The collapse in the global honeybee population is a major threat to crops and it is a product of multiple and often interacting factors. Beekeeping in EU27 is practiced mainly traditionally with little progress to report over the last 30-40 years in terms of innovation in techniques, methodologies or business practices and so it maintains an extensive rather than intensive nature. One of the primary constraints towards automation and intensification of the processes involved beekeeping has been the physical impossibility of beekeepers adequately recording beehive inspection and production data. Our proposed solution is a mobile phone application and web service, which will enable beekeepers worldwide to: i. Record, monitor and analyze production related data of beehives via a Voice User Interface (VUI)-guided, structured and optimized beehive inspection routine ii. Improve productivity by suggesting practices via a built-in decision support software based on unique, field-tested methodology offering : a) Advanced yet simple in practice productivity enhancement methods b) Holistic approach towards minimization of bees morbidity parameters(parasites, viruses, management issues, starvation, queen related issues) targeting the optimization of colony internal defense mechanisms. c) Production monitoring optimization and finally d) offer pollination services to farmers.

To solve this, we propose a 3D-Printing platform that takes various 3D-Data sources as input and transforms them to 3D-printable data. This is done by a set of automatic and interactive analysis and repair functions. Adding pricing, checkout and printing ability, this one-stop-shopping platform enables users to get high-quality 3D-printed models without in-depth 3D printing knowledge., We propose an architecture that implements the core 3D printing value-chain. It handles incoming data and organizes user authentication; analyzes the data for printability and possible optimization; repairs and optimizes the 3D models (both with automatic algorithms and interactive tools); adds further 3D data to the project; calculates prices based on materials; and handles data transfer to the optimal 3D printer operator. Reference functions are implemented, ensuring full functionality. Further services can be integrated by our interfaces and over the FIWARE Context Broker component. The backend communicates with the FIWARE Synchronisation component, which itself is connected to the FIWARE 3D UI XML3D frontend. Mashup widgets for the FIWARE Wirecloud component (linked to the API via the Context Broker as proposed in the Fitman architecture) provide the user with a visual interface to configure the system., As a Spin-Off from Technical University Berlin, we develop 3D Printing CAD plugins since spring 2013. Our proposed platform bridges the gap between data-creation points and printer operators. Due to its modular architecture, many other apps and services can be integrated in order to provide and process 3D data. This will greatly increase the effectiveness of business processes connected to the 3D printing supply chain. It will support the use of 3D printing for product development and help creative workers such as construction engineers, architects and designers to be more competitive.

REMS-soft is an open-source Cloud-based Energy Management architecture, able to connect to any type of energy sensor of building energy device. REMS-soft uses energy data from any energy sensor technology, and translates it into one open-source architecture. A common open-source architecture is key to optimize the energy systems at different levels: individual building, community, city, region. , , Currently energy data in Smart Cities is dispersed, non-integrated and generated by heterogeneous sensors. Sensors in building electric devices (e.g. electric meters, heat pumps,\u2026) use different communication technologies, are not-compatible and non-integrated, which creates a problem to use, analyze, and optimize energy data even at individual building level. , , REMS-soft provides a modular solution, as it can be installed in one single building at a time. As the installed base (also of similar open-source softwares) grows, compatible energy data can be analyzed to optimize the energy system. , , In Soul Fi Round A, VES will build a Proof of Concept architecture of REMS-soft, as well as develop a detailed Business Plan. VES aims to launch REMS-soft as a commercial product (licensed software) within 12 months.

This means there will be an extra billion mouths to feed within the next 12 years. And within one generation, there will be more people additionally on the planet than there were at the beginning of the 20th century. Feeding the growing world population poses an unprecedented challenge to human ingenuity. Even in the best of circumstances, sustainably satisfying this hugely increased demand for crops and livestock will be an enormous task. By 2050, food production must increase by 70% to keep pace. , European Agriculture needs to become more productive and at the same time to meet environmental goals. Reconciling food production and environmental goals can be achieved through the adoption of appropriate technologies. Frequently farm entrepreneurs do not have the right information at the right time in order to manage efficiently both their farm production and the phytosanitary (pesticide and fertilizers) treatments needed for the health plants. Moreover very often the information related to sow /harvest /treatments are not interconnected with the pesticide and fertilizers storage and are used only for administrative scopes.

These data will be elaborated in space and time across an urban area using a multi-criteria analysis modeld and processed using FIWARE enablers for data access, input/output management, computational distribution and geo-visualization. Based on this, outdoor comfort index and related comfort context information will be provided interactively to the used through both mobile or web based terminals, reported also in terms of KPI (Key Performance Index) .The proposed approach will intend to provide both an online outdoor environment monitoring service based on presented comprehensive comfort index, and a predictive system to forecast outdoors comfort variation on the basis of specific decisions from local authorities, as well as assumed or expected environmental conditions or urban layout modifications. The project aims to increase urban quality of life of inhabitants, provide decision makers of required information to optimize urban development to maximize outdoors comfort and usability and  allow inhabitants to identify and select specific urban area for their outdoors activities  "},{"id_internal":"c238ecbe-02cf-4b45-989e-ef6271e8c555","node_type":"VIP","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"SpeedUp Europe","Q1_2":"Germany","Q1_3":"Open Energy Exchange","Q1_4":"OEEX","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"3.00","Q1_8":"2.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_11":"B","Q1_12":"Access Control Generic Enabler,Object Storage GE ,IoT Broker,Configuration Manager-Orion Context Broker,Backend Device Management,Complex Event Processing,BigData Analysis","Q1_13":"70000.00","Q1_16":"0.00","Q2_1":"TRL4","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"A","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"0.00","Q3_2b":"70.00","Q3_2c":"30.00","Q3_4":"G,F,D,A","Q3_5":"C","Q3_6":"2015","Q3_7":"A","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"B","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"A","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"10.00","Q4_3b":"10.00","Q4_3c":"10.00","Q4_3d":"10.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"C","Q4_6":"7.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer energy & home automation","B2B_B2C":"B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"X","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Hardware","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Data Integration and Access Software","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Application Development & Deployment","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Structured Data Management Software","SME_STARTUP":"Other","full_text":" We envision an open-source low-budget hardware and software solution, using a smart-plug integrated into a virtual social network to enable people to run their home appliances when there is green energy production close to their homes. As we target a broad audience not accustomed to automation technology, the utilization shall be as simple as possible. Therefore we build upon well known techniques from social media platforms to establish the connection between the device, the user and the renewable energy plant supplying the power needed., In contrast to social media based energy saving contests, which engage the user socially but do not interact with the power flow directly, the smart plug hardware contains sensors and a relay. Thus, fully automatic physical demand response can be accomplished, without the requirement of user interactions during runtime., For doing so, the website of the Open Energy Exchange (OEEX) shows details of nearby generators and their operators in a facebook-style profile on a map, from which users select the preferred target., As a bottom-up demand response innovation, we suggest to transfer the intuitive concept of Ã¢\u20acâ¢followingÃ¢\u20acâ¢ from social networks to smart grids: a power generator publishes its energy generation measurements and consumers can choose a target to follow with their flexible loads, e.g. an electric vehicle can follow the ownerÃ¢\u20acâ¢s or neighbourÃ¢\u20acâ¢s solar panel or wind generator. The flexible loads then aim to balance some of the fluctuation in generation, thus increasing the tolerable penetration limits of fluctuating energy sources., In contrast to Renewable Energy Certificates, which provide market segmentation and price discrimination but are prone to Ã¢\u20acâ¢greenwashingÃ¢\u20acâ¢, the Ã¢\u20acâ¢followingÃ¢\u20acâ¢ concept aligns the real power flows in the network, while giving the customer the chance to build up a personal relation to his preferred energy source and thus the energy consumed.

By acquiring a 360 degrees of data instantaneously the studio achieves high accuracies, depth of color, true pixel-to-point registration and allow for the scanning of animated postures. , , In this project the objective is to develop an integrated software solution to create realistic 3d humans for Illustrations, Animations, Games, measurement (clothing/body measurement/medical) and of course the main purpose print. The processing time for artist will be greatly reduced, quality increased and the number of final applications for the scan increased. The end result is a 3D point cloud processing software solution with use of meshing algorithms. The models will be ready to print on the latest industrial printers. Once we reduce the processing time for each scan, we could integrate a platform for scanned models, where artists from each application that uses 3D models can offer their skills. Such a platform, built with and combined with FIWARE could boost the use of 3d scans, prints and all other applications within Europe and boost productivity within a fast growing sector.,  "},{"id_internal":"82905ed1-1fe0-4d85-9285-9b499f22b829","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"S","Q1_2":"United Kingdom","Q1_4":"DPTD (MoreForMe)","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"3.00","Q1_8":"3.00","Q1_9":"35000.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_12":"POI Data Provider ,Object Storage GE ","Q1_16":"1.00","Q1_19":"B","Q1_20":"A","Q2_1":"TRL9","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2b":"50.00","Q3_2i":"50.00","Q3_3a":"I","Q3_4":"G,F,B,A","Q3_5":"C,B","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"C","Q3_12":"F","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"500.00","Q4_3b":"300.00","Q4_3c":"140.00","Q4_3d":"120.00","Q4_4":"C","Q4_5":"C","Q4_6":"20.00","full_text":"Our project is targeted to help town and city center businesses, particularly SME's, to compete against online shopping.

Based on a combination of FI-WARE solutions and MotoriaLab services, ski area users at any levels will be able to track their performance, store personal data and get individualized profiles. The personalization of the outdoor sport experience will be also offered with physical sites (sport rooms), also managed by the ski-areas. The HI-FIS infrastructure will be modular and deployable also in minor skiing resort, e.g. covering a sector for ski school training, competitive athletes, new aggregation areas for winter sports. The project Â timely addresses a potential critical risk for Alpine economy, of a decreasing access to ski areas, a key resource for the tourism ecosystem. Ski areas need to redesign their offer, with a specific attention to the new generations. Here we are envisioning a structured set of solutions that offers more competitiveness, with new approaches that will better sell their product: the experience of one day spent on the ski slopes. Â Moreover the market of smartphones and wearable sensors (WS) is growing fast. WS market has an estimated yearly CGAR of 30% in the next 3 years, market projections indicate that by 2018 137.27 million units of WS will be delivered. This project is remarkably valid in Trentino, where a major investment in the last years has led to the Â construction of a 800 km optical fiber network. Such infrastructure is currently not exploited by the tourism industry, and in particular novel services are lacking for the national and international customers. The FI-WARE framework will give the opportunity to build new fast ICT infrastructures for data and web services, also in remote places, with a specific focus to ski slopes and snow parks which are the new centre of interest for young people within ski areas. Â , , In the first phase of the project, MotoriaLab will develop HI-FIS hardware infrastructure and services as B2B product for ski-areas, delivering WIFI mesh network, video cameras set up, WS to be used plug and play and an entertainment booth at the end of the slope where to deliver the processed output (video, 3d mapping, georeferenced data coming form WS) to the user. The idea is to create a \u201ctake home your performance\u201d video and statistics like in a real entertainment fun park setup. A video of an experimental run performed last season on the Donei slope in Cermis is attached as documentation. A definite market interest on this product has already been indicated by two Ski Areas in Trentino: the San Martino di Castrozza - Tognola (for the snow park) and Cermis ski area (for the ski slope). A letter of interest for the product by the Tognola ski area manager can be found as attached external file. , , Secondly, HIFIS B2B services will be developed to provide measures and feedback as in a real outdoor laboratory: we aim to sell services for all those interested into having high resolution data about athletes performances (ski national teams, ski schools, ski clubs) and products or prototypes of the sport equipment industry. Remarkably, the University of Padova\u2019s Sports Research group (Prof. Petrone - School of Engineering) has already commissioned a HI-FIS prototype system o be used for the world conference ISSS 2015 in San Vito di Cadore (March 8-13 2015; Â info at http://www.isss2015.com/). Third, for the B2C market, motorialab will deliver web/mobile services connecting HI-FIS services to its Skilo web/app platform (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.fbk.mpba.skilo) to revolutionate and improve skiers skiing experience and entertainment. The final goal in this case is to enable for all HI-FIS users high resolution geospatial personal services as for example quantified self-tracking and self-evaluation, performance optimization. In terms of market expansion, we wish to offer HI-FIS\u2019s users a complete new skiing experience starting from Trentino and then marketing the product and its services at alpine scale and then around the world. Remarkably, the same infrastructure and business model could be used also for summer outdoor activities, as example downhill biking, mountain biking and bike parks. , , Â  "},{"id_internal":"b730c411-7a8e-4ca9-9755-13da6d42e1c9","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FICHe","Q1_2":"Spain","Q1_3":"Taniwa Soluciones, S.L.

Hupp creates a social ridesharing network, seamlessly fitting into user habits to connect compatible passengers and drivers in real-time, taking care of the who, when and where. , , The core innovation of Hupp is an easy to use mobile app paired with complex backend algorithms; the combination results in a platform that learns the user transportation patterns to then match in real-time friends, colleagues and compatible users to rideshare with. More than that, Hupp organizes the whole travel experience via push notifications, suggesting the optimal meeting place and time and showing the driver on the way, while splitting the ride costs and handling payments.,  Transportation is an important part of our lives, yet it's a market that has remained practically unchanged for over a 100 years. Providing better urban transportation has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people, creating a huge market.

For this reason they have little or no chance to attend cultural activities. We intend to bring these services to their own homes. Our business idea is to provide interactive, innovative and versatile cultural services to home-dwelling elderly with poor functional capacity. Our services will be co-created together with the end-users to better meet their true cultural needs and wishes., , Â , , In addition to the integration of the cultural services, the project includes a special focus on developing an interface that will be comfortable for elderly with only a little, if any, experience with modern technology., , Â , , A wide range of creative industry professionals (e.g. musicians, dancers, circus and theatre professionals) is also participating in the service design., , Â , , The nature of cultural services can be versatile (e.g. karaoke, citing poems, worship sessions, guiding through art exhibition) and they will be produced by professionals. The cultural services can be transferred to the end-users either online or as recordings with a volunteer supplying the interactive group discussions. According to our preliminary survey, numerous professional artists are willing to present their work with a symbolic fee - or even free of charge, at least during the test use - for an audience of elderly citizens., , Â , , The technology brought to the home of the elderly is an easy-to-use touch screen with a microphone, camera and video connection. We will not develop the technology as it is already available. For us the technology is only a platform to integrate our services., , Â , , In developing our services we are making the use of the following FIWARE enablers: Object Storage and BigData Analysis., , Â , , The business idea will be executed by our experienced professional team with excellent skills and vast professional networks. It has over 80 years of combined experience in user-driven service design, science, technology and business., , Â , , Our competitive edge derives partly from the design of easy-to-use services suitable for elderly people and from the efficient and professional production of services through the management of a large network of professionals. To be able to scale our service production we intend to utilize an open-source based tool, which enables us to recruit, schedule and manage our large network of artists and volunteers., , Â , , Our main competitors are other evolving organizations providing virtual arts. The present providers are mainly web-based and their services are not targeted to the elderly with significantly declined functional capacity. Â The present user-interfaces are also far too complex and unattractive for this target group., , Â , , Numerous studies are published showing the positive effects of arts and culture to a variety of health-related outcomes. Even an association with up to three years longer life span has been found. In addition to its recreational effects, participation and involvement in cultural events promotes health, social inclusion and networks., , Â , , The creative industry benefits from our product being able to reach an audience otherwise unreachable., , Â , , Our business idea is to meet the need for novel strategies for delivering new services for elderly care. The demand is growing due to the rapidly aging population and the simultaneous lack of financial and human resources. There is also a growing necessity to decrease the expensive institutionalized care and convert it to homecare, even for those who are increasingly frail and suffering from immobility, loneliness, fear, and isolation. To cope at home they need novel easy-to-use services delivered to their home.

People are interesting in sleep monitoring even without any physical issues. They try to improve their life quality. Our project is strongly related with human health.  DeepSleep is an innovative solution assisting parents and child therapists in monitoring, analyzing and improving sleep patterns in children aged 0-6. , It consists of three separate elements: a sleep monitoring device, dedicated smartphone application and cloud based web services which together provide therapeutic tips in real time, aid to correct improper behaviour patterns and stabilize sleep and wake cycles. Remembering that undisturbed and consistent sleep is an essential element of proper child development equal to eating or drinking, it assists parents, professionals and academics in developing emotional and mental capacities of the child, both short and long term. Sleep is recognized to help their physiological health while assisting therapeutic processes and adjusting metabolic needs. , The device is designed as a small attachable piece, encased in safe casing, which can be attached to any of the child\u2019s toys or daily use items. It continuously monitors the child\u2019s sleep and behavioural indicators and patterns. The data is sent to a smartphone, where a dedicated application, designed with therapeutic needs and parent communication in mind, processes it, displays important alerts and sends therapeutic advice to parents. , The application analyses the data gathered by the device, using therapeutic algorithms with targeted tips and recommendations based on populational data analysis and behavioral patterns discovery performed on the server. , In summary, DeepSleep provides a new opening in child development tools.

The business model is B2B2C, as the target customers are micro/small/medium coastal organizations and businesses (courses, rentals, events, marinas, etc.). The apps end-users will be the coastal organizations themselves and their customer base as the goal will be to greatly enhance the relationships between both and provide a new digital experience around the activity. The OpenCoast team gathers a unique experience in relation with the project NAOD, from IT architecture definition, software and web application development, through coastal data analysis and related project management. As importantly, the OpenCoast founders are passionated about watersports and have been practicing these nautical activities for more than 20 years, in more than 25 countries, and engaging with tens of industry stakeholders \u2013 with very close relationships developed with some of them throughout time. Since the beginning of our adventure, about a year ago, we actively engaged with both the Fi-Ware initiative and the OpenData community.

The establishment of a healthy behaviour arises as a modern turn for advancing both social and personal welfare and improving the quality of life. Towards this direction, the HealthBail project will deliver an online deliberation platform, which allows the professionals in the health care community, such as medical experts and doctors, build unanimity on defending against emerging symptoms and any kind of medical situations, according to evidence-based recommendations and best practices. Furthermore, the platform aims to relax the barriers for the general public in order to better access the professionalsÃ¢\u20acâ¢ knowledge about shaping and maintaining a healthy stance in all phases of their life, by sharing their symptoms and health related problems with these professionals and developing an early response attitude against such symptoms and medical issues. The outcome of the project stands beyond the replacement of the physical contact with the professionals to handle all types of health care issues, but offers services to virtually connect professionals with each other and with the general public.

A key part of any project and especially an R&D project, either externally sponsored or internally supported, is its accurate financing given the higher risks associated with R&D. Such projects are mostly initiated, developed and implemented by subject experts who are not necessarily experts on budgets and financial analysis. This invariably results in financial discrepancies in projects having similar scope, quality and time. The lack of time and long-winded processes/systems for financial management are major concerns (though of little interest) to most subject experts. The result is that subject experts are not in control of their budgets, which are handled mostly by administrators with lack of project specific research awareness. Many challenges remain in automating and learning about budgets from analysing successful projects. Our web app (called MyBudget) will help users to prepare budgets with no prior knowledge of budgeting rules or financial management in a simple yet intelligent way. This will be achieved by using the power of open data for similar kind of projects; specifically by using open data for finding unseen patterns in successfully sponsored R&D projects. Further, it would automatically breakdown a given or analysed budget in an effective way using predetermined calculated proportions depending on the type of budget.

This system will free the designers from, costs in protecting their works, still having some sort of protection of intellectual property, hence assuring an, income chance. On the other hand, people interested in buying have a benefit from low, scalable prices that varies, depending on the chosen object and on the required quantity., Wop3D will extensively use some of the Fiware technologies both in the Web Site (enablers for developing the, marketplace) and in the printing service (enablers connecting a network device to the cloud)., Such application could ease the spreading of 3D printing, since low prices intrigue buyers and incentive to try out, the service. In addition, printing a flawed model does not generate frustration. The limited time in which you get, the objects, associated with a wide range and competitive prices will affect the printer market, thereby enlarging, more and more the buying audience., This system offers to the designer, for the first time, a concrete source of income associated to the modeling of, consumer objects. We trust that this possibility will attract a high number of designers, creating free competition, between them on the Internet Portal, raising the quality level of the proposed models. A successful portal will be, seen as a showcase, an opportunity not to be missed for beginners, for established professionals and even for the, ones who target a niche area of the market.

Starting from this consideration, several models with different levels of sophistication have been defined to assess urban air quality and support decision making for pollution control strategies and traffic planning. However, what is lacking is a tool for estimating and forecasting the air quality level, depending on changing traffic conditions. The latter are in turn dependent on citizens\u2019 behavior (mobility behavior), which may vary in time and space. , The keyword of our project is then \u201cadaptive simulation\u201d: a mobility behavior affects the traffic morphology (in time and space), and eventually the air pollution level and its distribution. An adaptive simulation tool can interact with this variety of behavior classes, by translating them in different pollution sources, geo-located on the city map and corresponding to different pollution peaks. , A Local Government can use this tool to produce different scenarios and then suggest to citizens a series of improving behaviors, also modulating such suggestions according to estimated extreme/critical events (particular meteorological events, critical road works, scheduled social events, etc.) , On the other hand, the Citizen can play with this application to learn how a different behavior can affect the pollution level of his/her city., A User Interface (UI) will translate the User\u2019s selection into model data input, in turn processed by a simulator (server side). Then, model output will be released as open data set for public access., SmartAWARE will be released both as standard web and mobile application, and tested on (at least) two of the SOUL-FI Pilot Cities (Florence and Valladolid). , SmartAWARE will use several FI-WARE technologies: the simulator input and output will be managed by adapting specific FI-WARE technologies (such as, but not limited to, ENVIRO-FI, GeoServer, CKAN, IDAS, etc.) "},{"id_internal":"1f234ee7-2a58-4b84-86c5-b1d13b09f8a8","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FI-C3","Q1_2":"Spain","Q1_3":"Oblumi SL","Q1_4":"Oblumi tapp","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"5.00","Q1_8":"9.00","Q1_9":"11000.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"B","Q1_12":"Software Deployment and Configuration,Publish/Subscribe Context Broker,IoT Broker,Identity Management,Configuration Manager-Orion Context Broker,BigData Analysis,Authorization PDP","Q1_13":"112500.00","Q1_16":"1.00","Q2_1":"TRL9","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"A","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"B","Q3_2d":"100.00","Q3_3a":"F","Q3_4":"G,F,D,C,B","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2015","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"B","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"B","Q3_12":"A","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"200.00","Q4_3b":"100.00","Q4_3c":"40.00","Q4_3d":"40.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"80.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer health/wellness","B2B_B2C":"B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"X","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"X","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Services Operations Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Operations and Manufacturing Applications","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"The product is consumer oriented The product is an Smart Thermometer, for actual families.

Joint replacement surgery solves the problem and is indicated by looking at X-ray images of the joint. This is highly subjective. The result is that many surgeries are performed too early or too late, leading to unnecessary costs. With over 4 million surgeries performed globally each year this is a large and expensive healthcare problem for society.  OMAX (Objective Measurements of Arthritis in X-rays) is an online image analysis system that automatically detects osteoarthritis on X-ray images. Clinics around the world can link their X-ray systems to OMAX and use its analysis results instead of the X-rays. Radiologists will spend less time evaluating the X-rays. Diagnosis will become objective and reproducible. OMAX is self-learning and improves its accuracy with every new X-ray. In summary, OMAX saves time and money in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

The market of Intelligent Video Analytics for transportation, in 2013 was worth $180.0, million, and is expected to grow to $867.8 million by 2017., \u2022 It is expected to have an increasing CAGR of 30.4% from 2012 to 2017., \u2022 In 2013, Europe accounted for about 35.3% of the global revenue, and, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 28.6% from 2015 to 2017. There is a growing interest in solutions that rely on IoT devices for a number of sensing task. We tap into this phenomenon with an innovative product to carry out traffic monitoring. Project FLOUD will use the FIWARE platform to realize a cloud service able to automatically extract meaningful traffic statistics from a video stream, such as the number and type of vehicles passing by. The platform will receive incoming video streams, either taken from a recorded file or from a camera live stream, and will allow the user to configure one or more measuring locations, typically placed along the road lanes. The system will detect and count vehicle moving on motor lanes (such as cars, trucks, buses, bikes), and bycicle or pedestrian moving on dedicated lanes. , Today this task is carried out in most cases manually by operators acting for private companies, severely limiting the amount of data that can be actually produced with a typical budget. For instance, the UKDepartment for Transport carry out each year traffic counts from about 8.000 locations, where each site is counted on one single day in that year for a twelve hours period (http://goo.gl/cxxglb). It is obvious how the proposed automatic system could improve on the time each site is analyzed.   , The intended business model is to sell the service to professionals like city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers, who typically requires traffic flow data to conduct a variety of planning and operational activities. , The approach could be further expanded to include other types of video analytics in the future, for instance extracting information from people moving in large public places, a topic that is still currently actively researched in the computer vision community. On similar lines, other type of streaming media could be connected to the platform, such as audio sensors. , As a final note, we would like to point that this is not a project for building a video surveillance network: we will take in great care of the people's privacy, and all the information extracted by the system will be fully and completely anonymized.

MentalCheck will also offer the customers the possibility to personalized and create their specific templates, to generate reports on the patients evolution and export the data for its statistical analysis. This approach provide advantages to researchers and clinicians, since real-time assessments minimize the retrospective bias, can reveal dynamic processes, enhance the adherence to the treatment and the generalizability of results, and helps to prevent relapses. Moreover, MentalCheck consists of a multi-modal tool which can integrate psychological and physiological data, identifies situations - or the relation of symptoms in a specific context- and will provide interactive feedback in real time. Combining different technologies, FI-WARE Generic and Specific enablers will be implemented to ensure the security and data protection, and content specific APIs will increase the usability of the interface and create a network of professionals and institutions. Finally, Open Data will be used in the system to provide relevant drug information and to assess and compare the quality of mental health services. MentalCheck project follows the Lean Startup Methodology and its commercialization will be based on a freemium model.

The multi-sided platform visualizes the level of quality control in a meat supply chain for companies and supervisory bodies. One of the applications is food safety control: both the quality control department of a company and the supervisory body can access reliable and timely data on meat quality (e.g., salmonella, e-coli levels) provided by a certified laboratory. While the platform has already been tested with and adopted by one of the largest abattoirs in Europe, the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority promotes the research and development of a solution for data-integrity assurance. This proposal seeks the means to develop a fully automated triangulation service for data-integrity assurance in meat supply chains. The purpose of the triangulation service is to automatically compare food safety data provided by the abattoir with source data at the certified laboratory. The realization of such a triangulation service \u2013 within the broader set of controls of the multi-sided platform \u2013 should result in infallible quality control system for the entire meat industry in Europe.

The main outcome of the project will be the design and prototyping of PRESS (Pervasive Environment Sensing and Sharing), a novel Internet-enabled cost-effective product sensing air pollution and displaying data in an easy-to-use Web application. In this manner end-user will be able to monitor the quality of air in real-time as well as to view historical information, e.g., considering a given time period in the past., , In particular, end users will be able to deploy the PRESS box wherever they want, considering not only fixed locations such as houses and work-places, but also moving ones such as cars or bags of commuters. In fact, the PRESS box will be battery-enabled allowing also to use it for short-to-medium trips, GPS-equipped to relate sensed information with geographical locations, and small/lightweight to be easily carried-on. , , Moreover, end users will be able not to only to monitor the data sensed by their own PRESS box, but also to get an aggregated view of the data sensed by PRESS boxes of other users in a given geographical area and in a specific time period. In this manner, while each PRESS box will be useful to gather information of the private surrounding of specific users, the aggregated view will boost the knowledge of the quality of air of wider areas., , We strongly believe that the adoption of PRESS will strongly increase the environmental awareness of citizens, providing them with actual information of air pollution in a pervasive manner. In this way, citizens will be able to assess the overall quality of neighborhoods/cities where they live, eventually triggering more environment-friendly habits and pushing them to ask municipalities to undertake stronger actions to improve the quality of their natural environments.

This creative process has different problems and risks:, , Â , , 1) mental processes decrease in efficiency with time;, , 2) there is a growing number of resources that experts follow for inspiration, most of which involve expensive team meetings (i.e. brainstorming or customer panels);, , 3) there are other potential bottlenecks like blank paper syndrome or mental blocks, which add uncertainty to the process., , Â , , Creative experts need inspiration and agencies need more cost-effective and efficient workflows. Â , , Â , , The value proposition of Stoorm Flow is a digital-based process to generate and consume divergent ideas relevant to a project brief, such as a marketing campaign assignment. This process helps creative professionals to build \u201cresearch paths\u201d to explore ideas from different angles (objectives, causes, everyday stories, metaphors, etc.), and then classify and filter them in order to find a creative solution. In essence, the Stoorm Flow engine is a generator of ideas that supports a divergent exploration of information, rather than a convergent search such as in search engines., , Â , , The core technology of Stoorm Flow is a set of algorithms and methods that crawl the web through search engines and social media APIs, identifying and filtering creative and original ideas expressed in natural language. It includes semantic analysis algorithms to decompose phrases into iconic words and expressions, and look for representative images. Part of these algorithms are patentable and currently kept as industrial secret. Essentially, Stoorm Flow brainstorms the web relentlessly, divulging concrete ideas, and helping creatives to berrypick and organize them. It can also learn from its users and keep all the ideas it generates alongside user comments and their evaluation. In this manner, Stoorm Flow helps creatives in diversifying their creative paths and also helps them to converge efficiently onto the \u201cbig idea\u201d., , Â , , The first product prototype planned is a personal APP that allows users create a brief, generate and rate ideas, and share them with their teammates collaborating on the search for a specific idea or theme (e.g. for a marketing campaign). Teammates store the ideas they generate in a shared portfolio to facilitate collaboration, they can also filter and grade the ideas they receive in order to pick the most adequate ones(s) collaboratively. Subsequently, we are planning to develop a series of specialized products, each addressing a different generic use case (e.g., searching for a marketing idea, a company name, a slogan, a motto for a political campaign, etc)., , Â , , The first business model adopted for this stage is a Business-to-Business Software-as-a-Service. Companies in the creative business (e.g., advertising agencies) buy brief* packages as credits, which are consumed by their creative teams as they use the APP to look for ideas. Companies own the ideas they generate, but our platform learns from successful cases to better its outcome in future cases. Our previous evaluation tests with the seven companies show that the use of our technology reduced the cost of the ideation process by 50%, made ideation more productive and enjoyable, and tended to democratize it., , Â , , (*) a brief is a single creative assignment open for a maximum of one week, allowing unlimited search and users.Â The theme of the assignment is defined by at most three concepts.

The company was founded by two Ph.D., Andrea Carcano (holding a Ph.D. in Cybersecurity and InfoSec expert) and Moreno Carullo (holding a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering expert). Nozomi main focus is the development of products for protecting, monitoring and troubleshooting Industrial networks with a particular focus on energy systems and smart grid. In the latest years, Industrial Critical Installations started to use massively network interconnections, and what it is worst they came in contact with the public network, i.e. with Internet. The net effect of such new trend, is the introduction of a new interleaved and heterogeneous architecture combining typical information system (e.g. data bases, web-servers, web-applications and web-activities), with real-time elements implementing the control functions of industrial plants. If, from a certain point of view, the advantages of such complex architectures are several (remote management functions, distributed con-trol and management systems, on the fly monitoring etc. ), on the other hand they intro-duce a new layer of exposure to malicious threats. These specialized hardware and software equipment used in these critical installations (eg. Smart grids, power plants, pipeline etc.) often communicate with specialized protocols engineered with availability, speed and reliability in mind. InfoSec issues are, however, often not covered thus leaving such critical protocols (Modbus, IEC-61850-5-101/104, MMS, GOOSE, SampledValues, etc) and architectures (IEC 61850) with open flaws for a wide range of cyberattacks. In addition, day-by-day operation can be seriously impacted by hardware or software malfunction that in such distributed scenarios can be really hard to detect and recover quickly. Both these two scenarios need an integrated, advanced external monitoring system able to detect and record system failures, with integrated tools supporting operators in recovering the system and preventing future incidents. We have envisioned a platform, the Nozomi Industrial Global Critical State Guardian (IGCSG), currently composed by two different products: Nozomi SCADAguardian (SG) and Nozomi Industrial Event Monitor (IEM). The first has already been developed by Nozomi and the latter will be developed thanks to INCENSE/FIWARE resources. These two products permit to visualize current a past behavior of the monitored Industrial networks, allowing operators to find and resolve security and operational issues of the involved components. A recognized plus of our product is a state-of-the art, advanced, responsive HTML5 interface with graphic controls aimed at synthesizing network-related and process-related data, at various levels of details. Nozomi Networks is strucutered as a technological Vendor, with revenues coming from product sales, product support and professioanl services. In the Product services price section of the business plan further details are available. Future developments of the company will add additional revenue streams, for instance other components of the platform or integrated Industrial Cybersecurity services.

One of them, focused on raise private equity has been growing during the last years, both on private funds and Internet alternatives (crowd funding platforms, list of business angels like angel.list and others). This part is being improved year?by?year and becoming much more popular. Access to other alternative funding like public funding hasn\u2019t improved in any way. Although the information related to such funding public programmes is Open Data, and published to be available for every company/person, it is not structured in any way; the requirements and conditions to participate are continuously changing so the several financial schemes existing in Europe are quite difficult to be understood and followed by the majority of the companies -because are highly time and personnel recourses consuming?. In this sense many companies should contact experts to advise them on how to participate. There is not any initiative/advances to aggregate all the public information about public funding in Europe, just small companies showing a small spectrum of the European public funding scope. FUNDERA will integrate all the European public data about funding schemes, allowing without any cost, be understandable and accessible for any company.

CITIUS a) implements a collective intelligence solution, which collects and processes real-time movement information using citizens' smartphones, leverages the load of any post processing application and transforms citizens to smart sensors, b) increases the influence of citizens to the decision making process (fleet management), since collective information is directed from citizens to the city services and is considered when reforming local transportation, c) collects real-time information about how citizens move around and are able to promptly react upon emerging or constant needs, and d) offers intelligent transportation services to citizens by exploiting the wisdom of the crowd. With the provided smart analytics, the city can think forward and act proactively without investing on sensor network infrastructure. Local government will be able to efficiently allocate transportation resources and handle sudden congestions. Citizens on the other side will have a smart mobility application in their mobile phones, which provides information about their city, makes routing suggestions (notifications related to the exact location of the bus, alerts to get off the bus and/or buses arrival, etc.) that minimize their transportation time. The CITIUS solution is positioned in the so called data, knowledge and crowdsourcing market where the analysis of the information and the deployment of services on top of this information are sold. However, CITIUS is going a step further. It will deal with market domains that influence the aforementioned domain, namely the mobile technologies (e.g. smartphones provide instant access to transportation open city data), the semantic Web 3.0 technologies that manage and analyse huge amount of data (e.g. natural language processing techniques and Big data processing tools) and the trend to support open-minded transparent local government processes (e.g. processes that will benefit from open city data to shed light on city mobility problems)., Discussions with private fleet owners (private school buses) revealed an increased interest from several smaller companies. They are interested in monitoring their fleet and in offering notification services to their customers The decision makers of the public authorities are very interested in the crowdsourcing solution both because they can replace smart sensor networks with a low-cost alternative and because they can easily support the virtual reward mechanism with no-cost real rewards to the citizens In CITIUS we vision city-life as a two-sided market: a) on one side, we have the citizens who want to receive information concerning city POIs, the position and schedule of city moving units (e.g. the current position of a bus or the waiting time in bus stop) and the arrival or delay of expected moving units (e.g. the school bus that brings their kids home). As members of the city, they also want to actively participate in city decisions and are interested in having a city mayor that listens citizens\u2019 pulse; b) on the other side, city administratives want to collect information about their cities in order to better plan the provided services. They either run city-wide studies based on polls and questionnaires that collect citizens\u2019 opinions or use sensor networks in order to collect various type of information from their city (e.g. traffic, bus delays).

These patterns cannot be detected by the human eye. This helps the medical specialist to detect early warnings for those diseases, and make it possible to start treatment in a very early stage.

More than 25% of the visits in Museums are students or school groups and often the way that Cultural institutions approach them doesn't fit their reality, since the returning rate among teenagers is lower than 3%. Audioguides or guided tours are not enough to understand the complexity of the legacy exposed in these cultural organizations. The channel that millenniums are using is based on their smartphones and tablets, that's why culture needs to start approaching them in this way., , Â , , As a solution, CloudGuide offers a universal app and a platform for museums and art galleries, allowing them to communicate their heritage through multimedia guides. The CloudGuide appÂ  already exists, but now we are aiming to develop the spin-off app called CloudGuide Education, just focused on the educative environment. The development itself would not be complicated, since CloudGuide Education maintains the same structure as its \"\"mother\"\" but with a completely new input of features specialized for this target. Moreover, the company has an already existing museum network willing to test it.Â  This way we unite all the content of the museums around the world with the focus on interactivity and quizzes for the youngest., , Â , , CloudGuide and CloudGuide Education will be a perfect complement for visitors (specially families), schools and cultural institution. With CloudGuide Education, Museums Education Department's will get an access to the platform allowing them to start creating multimedia and interactive guides without any investment. The traditional CloudGuide system supports audio, video, additional text, links, suggested routes, etc, but now with the new Education project they will get the possibility to transform this content into play&amp;learn games/quizzes, social conversations and introduce interactive objects. Moreover, museums can examine all the related statistics gathered through our app., , Â , , Students, school groups and people with special needs will no longer have to carry around the old-fashioned unhygienic audioguide or download multiple apps per museum. Everything will be consultable from a single multi-lingual app that provides them with a new art and culture experience, CloudGuide for Education will allow them to interact with any exhibit (artwork, science experiment, design object), understand the real author motivation or simply get a better perspective of that exhibit background., , Â , , These users will be able to tag and rate exhibits, leave comments and share their experience with friends on Facebook and Twitter, take part in conversations among each other, play and learn at the same tame, making the whole process of visiting museums more entertaining and interactive. Moreover, it is adjusted to the visitors' interests, providing them with preselections of popular routes they may be interested in. School and student groups will be able to enjoy the route created for them specifically by their professor, examine his comments, share notes and participate in discussions., , Â , , Finally, CloudGuide Education will make technology and mobile applications in museums accessible to everyone, since we have already been contacted by he aws!

We called it \"\"Cityfunding\"\", an innovative concept that combines the city - its people, spaces, resources, and dynamics - with the potential of crowdfunding, a widespread and ever growing system that allows ideas to become real thanks to small contributions coming from a large number of players., , We believe that in the present circumstances of crisis - scarcity of significant public and private investment for improving the quality of urban life - a bottom-up and incremental approach to city-making represents a reliable alternative to the current planning process, often slow and ineffective in the mid and short term. The intelligence of the crowd turns to be a key ingredient to deal with such fragile situation., , Cityfunding aims to create the essential conditions for developing small, temporary projects on the city. This is achieved by making useful information about existing / potential opportunities, accessible and interactive. Users can take advantage of this knowledge to build local networks around their ideas and collect the needed resources. Cityfunding is a crowdfunding platform attached to real places., , Digital and physical space are integrated in a hybrid system, where real markers placed in the city complement the online tool for networking and crowdsourcing.

This exposure might have negative health effects, both physical and psychological, and citizens\u2019 awareness is highly increasing. Thus, in last decades, regulations concerning environmental noise and gas exposure have been developed. For these reasons, the development of dynamic noise maps, which frequently vary and allow monitoring of annoying events, as well as the design of gas emissions frameworks are a necessity that must contribute to the effectiveness of municipal action plans.,  In this context, the product we present, an App able to offer this information in an attractive and intuitive way, plays a central role. The rise of smart cities, as well as citizens\u2019 services monitoring, supposes the parameterization of cities using sensors, something very useful for the development of our system. This way, the proposed App will be fed not only with data from our own sensors, but also from data coming from other sensors spread in cities. The reuse of open data is a key point in our project. Besides, FIWARE usage will make the standardization of the data related to the environment and their following spreading easier. This will allow authorities and citizens the precise monitoring of action plans.,  To sum up, thanks to the reuse of open data and people\u2019s participation, citizens and authorities will walk together to contribute to create a healthier advanced society supported by science and knowledge based on open data.

We are developing anti-theft system for bicycles. More than a billion of bicycles are present in the world. Millions are stolen every year. In this project, we are working on a solution to this problem which we call KISSMYBIKE. It is a new advanced anti-theft system designed specifically for bicycles. The core service provided by our system is the theft detection and tracking of bicycle location. In contrast to existing solutions, the KISSMYBIKE tracking device is invisible, charge-less, accurate and affordable. It features ultra-compact robust design that allows installing it into a bicycle construction and hiding it from hand and eye. The combination of smart adaptive algorithms and energy efficient electronics enables several years of operation on a single charge. The system comprises cutting edge satellite and mobile technologies in order to accurately track a bicycle location in different conditions in the event of theft. In addition to the tracking service, we introduce theft prevention services which include safety level estimation and parking recommendations. Moreover, we assist bicycle owners in a legal retrieval process by providing them with emergency numbers, locations of the nearest police stations, and necessary bicycle identification information for police reports. Open cloud-based FIWARE infrastructure is intensively used in order to build a scalable and a cost-effective solution.

So, application structure will be saved on Fi-ware and data will be loaded from City Point of interest and open DataSets, saved on Fi-Ware. Next, we will develop an interpreter that traduces structure and data designed by technical user, into each smartwearable language. For instance, android devices understand Java technology, and Apple devices iOS Kit. We will be able to unify these wearables technologies into just one.

Pest and disease diagnostics are sought by farmers either by talking with each others, by calling a specialist or by sending plant samples to certified laboratories for analysis. Respectively, these ways seem to be ineffective, not be readily available (or not available at all) or take longer than needed. OpenPD, an on-the-field and on-the-fly system for fast identification of plant pests and diseases, aims to provide a way to shorten the response time for a correct diagnostic of plant and crop pests and diseases by speeding up the process of identification. Supported by a database and a mobile app, users submit a digital photo of the affected plant part along with other relevant data and receive an answer leading to the diagnosis, coming from other users (general or specialists) or automatically by image interpretation and/or by a learning algorithm taking previous (positive) users answers. OpenPD will be reactive (users\u2019 questions and answers) but also proactive (sending warnings and alerts to users) and will be structured as an open community model. Answers should be evaluated and users rewarded and ranked using a ranking pyramid model (evaluation by the users but also by the system). OpenPD will make use of at least 6 generic enablers from the FIWARE Catalogue and be integrated in FISpace. OpenPD\u2019s business model customer acquisition component will by supported by its Freemium model, strategic partnerships with public and private organizations, media partnerships and digital media plan.

Drones, equipped with state-of-the-art radar sensors will be dispatched to take position over different roads and streets in a city to support conventional ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) in monitoring traffic. They will be able to monitor traffic at different locations, where static ITS systems, deployed in the form of gates or other fixed installations equipped with radars and cameras, are not present. The drones will transfer information on the measured traffic real-time to the traffic control center. In this way, global traffic situation will be known. The new system will allow for a revolutionary step forward in the traffic management. It will lead to a true, real-time, global traffic monitoring and management in a given city. It will support different emergency services as police, medics and fire brigades to get to their destination taking best route, avoiding traffic jams and more congested streets. Also, individual drivers will receive information on how to get fastest from place A to place B, avoiding traffic jams and congested passages. This would also provide further, environmental benefits of reduced emissions. Such a service is not possible currently, as presently deployed ITS systems are static by design and manage traffic only on selected main avenues.

Because the app depends on GPS signals, its reliability inside of buildings is limited. BlindSquare LandMarkers is an indoor navigation system using Bluetooth beacons, which can send signals to modern smartphones. It will help blind and partially sighted users to explore buildings virtually and to locate and navigate to POI inside of buildings., , Â , , Problem, , Â , , Navigating inside of public buildings (Stations, malls, office buildings) poses different challenges to blind and partially sighted people than travelling in the streets. Outside, visually impaired people often find more landmarks (pavement, tactile paving, different echoes of walls, trees, bushes, fences, audible traffic lights) than are available inside of buildings. Inside office buildings, doors and corridors are similar. In shopping malls, paths are often blocked by signs or decoration, constant background music masks echoes, and other audible clues are lacking. Printed signs are inaccessible to blind individuals. GPS reception generally is too poor to compensate these difficulties using smartphones., , Â , , Project Description, , Â , , MIPsoft has not only developed BlindSquare, but also CLIS, the Customized Location Information Service. Clis allows organisations to provide customised information about their premises to blind and partially sighted guests, clients, students, or staff who use an iOS-device running BlindSquare or BlindSquare Event. CLIS is already being used successfully at the University of Iowa., , BlindSquare LandMarkers will make CLIS available indoors. Bluetooth beacons will be placed at certain points to provide information or directions., , Â , , Advantages, , ,  Up to now, most indoor mapping approaches determine the user's position in a building through triangulation. They rely on WiFi, magnetic fields, or beacons to map the building. If WiFi or magnetic fields are used, the location of different places inside a building first have to be entered on the map. Only then can the user be located on the map and receive directions. BlindSquare LandMarkers are simply placed inside the building and are linked to cloud data that can be edited at any time if required. It is not necessary to fingerprint a building and create a map.,  ,  ,  Other approaches using beacons require that the range of beacons cover all of the building, so it is possible to create a map and use triangulation.,  ,  ,  We estimate that BlindSquare LandMarkers will require ten times fewer beacons, because this method does not use triangulation. The beacons are placed at important points, like signs or signposts used by sighted people. The user is then guided from beacon to beacon until they reach their destination. Messages received at each beacon depend on the user's direction and the beacons last detected by the user's device. This makes BlindSquare LandMarkers more affordable and easier to install than other systems.,  ,  ,  There have been other attempts to map indoor locations for blind and partially sighted people. Step-Hear requires that the user wear a special bracelet that vibrates when a transmitter is approached. In contrast to this approach, BlindSquare LandMarkers uses the devices many visually impaired people already own, their smartphones. Bluetooth Beacons are also being produced for the mainstream market. Because BlindSquare LandMarkers does not require custom-made equipment, it is more cost effective than methods that use components specifically designed for visually impaired users.,  , Â  "},{"id_internal":"13b6a90d-1ccf-4d31-8c13-a151e5d4f18e","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"Fractals","Q1_2":"Hungary","Q1_3":"Qualysoft Informatics Ltd.","Q1_4":"AgriPortal","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"A","Q1_7":"10.00","Q1_8":"133.00","Q1_9":"10330357.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Software Deployment and Configuration,Self-Service Interfaces,Identity Management","Q1_13":"0.00","Q1_16":"15.00","Q2_1":"TRL2","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"A","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"0.00","Q3_2b":"99.00","Q3_2c":"1.00","Q3_4":"F,C","Q3_5":"B,C,A","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"A","Q4_1":"C","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"20.00","Q4_3b":"20.00","Q4_3c":"50.00","Q4_3d":"65.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"40.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service Provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Procurement","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Enterprise Resource Management (ERM) Applications","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"Agricultural Portal for the Support of Preferential Purchase and Cost Effective Sale (AgriPortal), The main objective of the portal is to facilitate cross-country preferential purchase and cost-effective sales in various agricultural sectors.

The U3D camera ball builds the bridge between virtual reality (VR) devices and the real world. Building a camera like this, means that a complete new media format will emerge that is able to contain and process more data. We believe, this format will become a new media standard and co-exist with formats like mp4. U3DP shall be the link between our camera and 3D printing and show people how easy it easy to apply 3D printing technology to create something useful. , , U3DP is a crowdsourcing web-shop for 3D printing designs to improve the original camera and will be an extensive service to incorporate 3D printing technology to the existing offer. The best way to explain this concept is to see it as a combination of the GoPro camera (http://gopro.com/), VRJaunt (http://www.jauntvr.com/) and the 3D printing web-shop Sculpteo.com (http://www.sculpteo.com/). Potential to innovate either camera or platform can be found in both incremental and radical terms. , , In the future, we want to test market opportunities to expand the utility of U3D to measure the distance of objects within the environment around the camera. That could become interesting for urban planners, architects or interior designers. With consideration to improve water and pressure resistance, it could even be useful for deep sea explorations. Generating input of the depth of space in combination with the possibilities of U3DP, could allow users to access the precise measurements of respective environmental settings in 3D and enable them to print them out., , Because U3DP is in its purest sense a web-shop, we need cloud storage, access and file management, and payment features.

Most 3D printing companies, on the other hand, struggle to find enough customers to obtain a sufficient return on their investment. Also, they often need to spend time making models printable., , Research shows that the European 3D printing industry will grow in the near future, which will result in a significant increase of the demand for a smoother interaction between both 3D printing content providers and 3D printing companies. , , Layered Prints aims to develop software (an API) that bridges the gap between both groups and tackles their specific challenges. It will enable the 3D printing content providers and their customers (end-users) to have the most appropriate 3D printing company automatically selected in terms of price, physical distance and specific printing material needs. , , The software will allow 3D printing content providers to offer their end-customers a streamlined 3D printing service whilst they keep focus on their core business. They will enjoy a quick, safe and eco-friendly printing and order fulfilment. , , The printing companies, on the other hand, will benefit from a greater return on their investment as they will get more customers without having to put in the effort themselves. Moreover, the model checker and repairer will ensure that only ready-to-print files are sent to the 3D printing companies. The integrated billing process will free-up wasted administrative time. , , Because the LP3D team has experience with FIWARE generic enablers, use of the FI-WARE ecosystem and its generic enablers together with specific enablers from the FITMAN platform, will not only decrease development time but also ensure a shorter time to market and a better platform scalability.

Indeed, the so-called Quantified Self movement has become a mainstream concept, enabling the continuous (or quasi-continuous) monitoring of key physiological indicators. For instance, countless devices are available, such as pedometers, heart rate monitors, and sleep trackers, that empower individuals to self manage their well-being in an objective, evidence-based approach. One of the most popular tendencies in this field at the moment is the use of wearable devices, such as bracelets. However, this is not always practical, both in terms of user experience and technical requirements specific to the signals being monitored. One alternative is the integration of these physiological sensors into everyday objects, thus minimizing disruptions in the user\u2019s routine. In this project we propose to develop a solution that allows the seamless measurement of the heart signal (the electrocardiogram - ECG) in a car steering wheel. Our system enables the detection of abnormal cardiac events, drowsiness and fatigue, as well as driver identity, raising alarms in case any problem arises. This is complemented with FIWARE technology to deploy an SaaS solution, integrating contextual information from multiple sources, as well as allowing us to make our data processing algorithms available to other information sources.

The jobs of many people rely on accurate and timely information about opinions Ã¢\u20ac\u201c among them product developers and business developers, journalists, researchers and politicians. Yet, there is no one place that provides the latest information about public opinion easily, valid and fast. The mission of sentibar is to close that gap. sentibar uses smart algorithms to collect information about opinions and attitudes from surveys and opinion polls. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a news aggregator that provides external links to survey results. Listening closely to user feedback we will gradually add features towards creating a proper data hub. The data hub offers users access to survey results and to complete data sets. Interactive visualization and reporting are further features that improve the user experience. The vision is that we enhance data quality, provide data access and therefore improve the opportunities for action of citizens., But sentibar does not stop there. We are passionate about surveys and we want to reveal hidden information. Users provide us with their interests so that we can deliver tailored information products. We see who is interested in the same topics and we can use this information to connect people with the same interests, building powerful knowledge clusters for Smart Cities around opinion data. Eventually, an international survey data base enriched by user interaction data is a unique treasure trove of information. It allows us to identify patterns, build better and new products. And we can share this knowledge with research institutions who are in turn interesting partners for us., This proposal lays the foundations for our larger endeavour. Some generic enablers are used for the MVP, while CKAN allows us to leapfrog and quickly reach the stage of a data hub. We will also explore how SpagoBI can be used in connection with CKAN to provide additional features such as generating reports.

The greenhouse farms production in Almeria has an important export focus. The sales to foreign markets was near 70% (Aznar et al. 2013), with Germany, France, Netherlands and UK as the main markets this production. Even though all these incomes and enormous export figures, there is a process of decrease in farmers incomes. Mean incomes per hectare are decreasing in long term, mainly because the decrease of prices (FundaciÃ³n Cajamar 2012). We see a business opportunity in improving some of the process involved in the production of Greenhouse ( In AlmerÃ­a we have 24000 Ha of Greenhouses and 12000 farmers). We will propose a product to increase efficiency of management of the Greenhouse reducing the time employed by different actors (owner, farmer, technician) involved in the process of production. Now the farmer has to monitor and control on site the parameters (temperature, humidity, water, etc) of the Greenhouse, and the technician has to check that the production process is according the best practices. Finally there is a security problem because many of the Greenhouses remain isolated. This produces a problem of additional cost because robberies. All these processes need to be more efficient to reduce costs. The solution proposed to increase productivity will have the following components: \u2022 Outsourcing to the Cloud of monitoring and control of the production of the Greenhouse. This will be done by means of the services created with FI Ware enablers.. \u2022 It is a SaaS, pay per use service, that lets to consider potential customer to any farmer with their own solution of sensors. \u2022 Connection to the B2B data base, publish in open Marketplace, receive anÃ¡lisys and advices possible actions about GH Parameters \u2022 Tools for farmers based in easy app in smartphones with access to the Greenhouse parameters stored in the Cloud \u2022 Update sensor technology, using new Zigbee, Zwave technology instead of the present wired old sensors, and new monitoring and control algorithm.

As it is known, the world of 3D printing has focused from the beginning on the shape of objects leaving behind the problem of their coloration. Most of 3D printing options available are restricted to a small handful of basic colors; it is true that recently some 3D printers full color came on the market, but they are quite expensive and professional oriented. Some 3D printing services on line started to offer full color option but not at an affordable price., Our solution addresses the problem from a different perspective: the coloration is provided by means of decals which are glued on the object after it is printed. Decals are created using an innovative web app which allow to paint over a 3D surface. The finished design is then printed on paper for decal., Our solution is flexible: decals are applicable to a wide range of materials: FDM, WDM, polyJet etc, provided that the geometry is not too complex., Our solution is scalable: it can be added as an add-on service to existing on line 3D printing services or it can be used for free by single users that print by themselves the decals., Our solution is pragmatic: it avoids using expensive technology to color 3D objects; even existing 3D objects can be refreshed with colors. Moreover objects can be repainted by removing existing decals and applying the new decals or simply by overlapping them., Our solution is innovative: the web app which is part of the solution is designed as a tool which allows everyone to paint digitally a 3D model without 3D solid modelling skills.

The model that is the basic inference engine of the app helps farmers optimize their annual income, taking into account labour hours, among other variables. EU farmers have gradually acquired more animals over time so as to be eligible for higher/more subsidies. This has led to big and difficult-to-manage flock sizes, additional fodder costs and pasture degradation. With rising fodder prices in the international market, farmers could afford less fodder but flock sizes were not reduced, inevitably leading to overgrazing and pasture degradation. Consequentially, the quality of pastures has been deteriorating while the animals are malnourished and less productive. Our calculations show that a reduction of stocking rate (number of animals), at constant level of subsidies and expenditure on imported fodder, would lead to higher incomes (an average 35%). SSRF-DSS is an integrated platform where stakeholders (farmers or other bodies) will - Use the model, through a user-friendly web interface, for an EU area with tested factors, to plan their annual income in an optimal and environmentally friendly way. - Input data for different EU areas where key factors vary (such as subsidies, land rent costs, fodder costs etc). - Help interconnect the app with other FIWARE-enabled apps or Open Data sources within the EU (eg. subsidy or price data) that can facilitate accurate, real-time decision support.

You could not bother or already failed? We give people the opportunity to grow their own food, even if they have limited time, space or experience, as it is often the case in urban areas. Although urbanization has caused many people to live without direct contact to agriculture, many citizens (e.g., LOHAS) set high value in healthy food, and they are aware of the importance of sustainable and organic cultivation. The Family Farming application approaches this task by a combination of a smart raised-bed gardening box, called the Agrarium, with a wireless web and mobile application that guides the user to a successful harvest. Thanks to the FIWARE Generic and Specific Enabler (GE/SE) software libraries, we are able to efficiently and easily implement complex Internet of Things (IoT) intercommunication. The successful real world farming experience depends critically on FIWARE which provides a sophisticated framework for various tasks, including data exchange and analysis, user interface design, social networking and access control. Sensors within the Agrarium provide data about temperature, humidity, luminosity and nutritional value which the customers can use and which will be evaluated and illustrated by selected FIWARE software solutions. The web and mobile applications provide the user with appropriate guidance and instructions based on context data evaluated by the FIWARE network. Since FIWARE Enablers went open source, we are able to contribute to the developing community. We will help to drive FIWARE forward into the future while benefitting from a network of experienced programmers, hence reducing production cost and time. Our project guarantees a successful farming experience to people who wish to produce their own food and the FIWARE Enablers help to re-establish an awareness not only for the importance of sustainable food but also for the complex challenge of urban agriculture.

There are many factors conditioning a diabetic\u2019s life: carbohydrates, stress level, glucose monitoring, insulin doses and physical activity are just few among many others. The main concern of a diabetic is to keep blood glucose levels within a safe range. This process is called self-management.,  Our platform will collect health-related data of diabetic users and will use machine learning to help them with their self-management. Since environmental factors have an impact on self-management, we will use open data and geolocation to correlate them with diabetics\u2019 blood glucose levels. One of the biggest problems of self-management for a diabetic person is to properly count the grams of carbohydrates in a meal. We want to use image recognition and machine learning to take that burden from them. Finally, diabetics might grant an access to their data to the doctors - to give them a better understanding of the patient\u2019s condition, which is essential for adjusting the insulin therapy.

OpinyourÃ¢\u20acâ¢s developments are instantiated as a computational mirror, Opinyour eMirror, acting similarly as real mirrors being able to augment reality by synthesizing imaginary views and features according to the desired application. Current OpinyourÃ¢\u20acâ¢s developments are still limited to a stand-alone application running on a conventional local PC-webcam-display. As a consequence the progress in commercialization and wide adoption has been severely hampered by the lack of an easily accessible web-based service providing the same functionality to any hospital-, medical school- or local surgery-PC over the Internet. An initial market analysis and preliminary trials with specialist surgeons in Slovakia, the UKand Brazil, shows that wide commercialization and adoption of the technology can be only achieved by the provision of a web-based service easily accessible over the internet.,   "},{"id_internal":"e186074b-9aef-4c60-8632-fd7e9c95127c","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FINODEX","Q1_3":"EZ LAB srl","Q1_4":"AgriOpenData - A Decision Support System to manage herbicides and fertilizers treatments, ","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"4.00","Q1_8":"3.00","Q1_9":"80000.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"B","Q1_12":"Publish/Subscribe Context Broker,POI Data Provider ,PEP Proxy ,Identity Management,Complex Event Processing,Authorization PDP,2D-UI","Q1_13":"50000.00","Q1_16":"1.00","Q2_1":"TRL7","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2b":"50.00","Q3_2f":"50.00","Q3_3a":"B","Q3_4":"F,C,B","Q3_5":"B,C","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"A","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"B","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"B","Q3_12":"K","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"B","Q4_3a":"50.00","Q4_3b":"100.00","Q4_3c":"100.00","Q4_3d":"50.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"60.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"End-User Query, Reporting, and Analysis","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Application Development & Deployment","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Data Access, Analysis, and Delivery Software","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"it is  peculiar for the application some stake holders in the consulting & service sector Not Applicable The AgriOpenData project aims to help farmers to improve their herbicides and fertilizers treatments, in order to make them more efficient and effective.

The expansion of 3D printing to consumers and throughout different industries has lead to many interesting applications. However, the connection between product customization and the human body shape is not well-established. One reason for this is that the use of 3D CAD tool for the authoring and modification of 3D models is still a specialized area, requiring skills in 3D modeling programs, and is a barrier for both companies and individuals when the creation or customization of 3D models is required., , 3D-HPC will be a web platform and asset management system that uses 3D scans of the human anatomy and provides geometric customization of desired products for a custom fit, which can then be printed out via consumers or via professional 3D printing providers. 3D-HPC works with 3D scans imported via various sources including 3D depth sensor scanners such as the Microsoft Kinect or Structure Sensor, but is designed around a photometry workflow. A modular photometry scanning system is being developed in parallel by STBL Medical Research AG (an industrial partner of the project), which is focused on developing wearable health sensors that benefit from layered manufacturing production and design customization. Their wearable sensors will be produced in conjunction with custom scanning using their photometry station at specific locations including pharmacies and hospitals. Once acquired, the input 3D mesh (wrist, arm, leg, etc) is then used as a target to modify a separate 3D product model. The final scaled model is then exported and produced via 3D printing methods.

Another burden for amateurs is the high costs of the hobby tools., In this project we focused on DIY costume pattern design, allowing users take part on the parts of the project where they feel comfortable and, of course, get their costume., Shusfuss is a community as well as an app to create clothes, masks and accessories using fabrics and 3D Printing. Through the app, users will be able to create new designs, share them and combine with pre-existing designs. Our main differentiation is the use of parametrical patterns that fit perfect to the user\u2019s body measurements and customize the accessories. Once the pattern is finished, users can print himself or order it in Shusfuss webpage. Shusfuss will provide 3D and 2D patterns in digital format as well as 3D printed accessories, 2D printed patterns, cut fabric pieces and assembled costumes. , The architecture of this project is based on FiWare. 2D and 3D models will be stored on the Cloud Storage. User interface will be created using widgets on Wirecloud. Store will be based on WStore. Offers will be composed by resources published on Cloud Storage. Manufacturing will be managed by an application based on FITMAN SE.

The user either downloads 3D-printer ready sliced files, or orders the manufactured part directly at partnering print service providers., , Initially, the web interface allows the user to customize the lattice structure by adjusting parameters such as knot density, typical rod length, rod thickness, regularity etc. Later, the web interface will be coupled to advanced state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, which will assist the user in designing optimized lattices for specific requirements., , To shorten the time to market, the service will use FIWARE. Meshify requires a web-based 3D user-interface (UI), cloud-based management of resources, and a webshop interface. These can all be translated into FIWARE enablers. In SML1, the UI will be implemented based on a FIWARE generic enabler from the category \u201cAdvanced web-based UI\u201d. In SML2, the scalability of the solution is assured by using the enablers in the category \u201cCloud infrastructure\u201d. In SML3, a webshop is attached using the enabler Store-WStore., , The impact of Meshify will be profound. The standard version targets two segments. On one side, designers and artists who wish to create designs with complex geometry and surface conformal lattices, which cannot be handled by today\u2019s CAD software. On the other side, consumers searching cost reduction opportunities. Both groups will benefit from significant reductions in manufacturing cost and time, as less material needs to be printed. The pricing of the service will be based on pay-per-use, thus removing up-front investments., , The advanced version of Meshify maximizes the utilization of printed material. This version is aimed at industrial manufacturers of advanced products ranging from lightweight aerospace components to advanced mechanical filters. Performance is improved, even more material is saved, and the cost is further decreased.

What is more, the app will allow access to the patient\u2019s authorized doctor enabling him to provide patients with optimum, care by accessing real time data, logging on prescriptions and comments., One of the strong points of the proposed application is its automated function of acquiring data from different devices-, applications such as: a) blood glucose laser or invasive meter devices that export digital data, b) GPS, application that calculates the running and walking exercise of the patients and c) heart rate measuring devices that detect, fainting episodes that allow the application to activate alarms towards familiars, doctors, ambulances or even nearby persons, offering them proper instructions for the patients recovery (e.g. sweets) in cases of life threatening emergency for the patient., This project makes use of FIWARE technologies.,  "},{"id_internal":"941388e8-f7eb-4741-9ef8-01620820d633","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FABulous","Q1_2":"Israel","Q1_3":"Kazzata","Q1_4":"Kazzata","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"4.00","Q1_8":"0.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Interface Designer,2D-3D-Capture","Q1_13":"18000.00","Q1_16":"1.00","Q2_1":"TRL4","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"B","Q3_2a":"80.00","Q3_2b":"20.00","Q3_2c":"0.00","Q3_4":"F,B","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"C","Q3_8":"B","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"A","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"10.00","Q4_3b":"20.00","Q4_3c":"50.00","Q4_3d":"100.00","Q4_4":"A","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"3.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"BUSINESS SERVICES, Consumer DIY/design, MANUFACTURING","B2B_B2C":"B2B/B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"X","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Content Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Content Applications","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"Kazzata intends to revolutionize the enormous spare parts supply-chain, by building the world\u2019s most comprehensive online repository of CAD spare part files for 3D printers. The site will be a marketplace, bringing together end customers (consumers and businesses) and file contributors (Manufacturers and 3D designers) to provide unlimited access to many types of spare parts, simply by printing them in a local 3D printer. For consumers, trying to obtain a rare or obsolete part for a beloved toy or broken appliance can be frustrating; for manufacturers, a missing part on a production line can cost millions of dollars in lost manufacturing time while waiting for the part to be delivered. Kazzata provides a quick, low-cost and environmentally-friendly option to have the needed spare part printed on-demand and locally on a 3D printer. , Innovation: Current spare parts supply chains are complex and expensive. Our solution disrupts the traditional spare part supply chain. When there is a demand for a spare part in a certain location on the globe, instead of flying the part form on corner of the globe to the other (which is expansive and takes time) you can simply print it in a local 3D printing service bureau. , We will build this repository along three axes: , Obtaining files directly from manufacturers who will partner with us and direct their clients to use our services whenever they need a spare part. Our service might be white labeled for the specific manufacturer of the spare part, Obtaining original design-files from 3D designers , Obtaining files designed on demand for spare parts based on requests initiated by end users on the Kazzata site, Our business model is predicated on our owning or licensing the CAD files for the long term, generating revenue (which will be shared with the manufacturer) each time a file is purchased or downloaded. , We already have MVP (minimum viable product) web site Kazzata.com and can try and integrate few Fiware modules such as 3D-UI-XML3D.

Information and communication technologies play a significant role in this by offering tools that help to optimize resources and increase its efficiency based on the ability to obtain and process city's information.  , , City councils and institutions are working hard to obtain the best results by adding \"\"intelligence\"\" to their city. The amount of information is increasing with better infrastructure. However, cities present a number of difficulties as this is costly and hard to implement. Furthermore, it's usual that their own citizens feel apart from these efforts., , In this proposal we emphasize the aspect that deals with implementing this kind of technology based solutions in cities by promoting the Internet of Things (IoT) as an enabler and facilitator that allows city assets, entities, and the most important, citizens to be part of a Proactive City., , In this context, the main objective of this proposal is to build a pilot in order to obtain a framework based on FIWARE which leads to a feasible and easy to implement technology for any city, of any type or size, encouraging the participation of citizens., , From our expertise, it's clear that there must be a common standard for connectivity. The cost and the lack of interoperability of vertical solutions from different vendors are enough reasons for making this technology difficult to implement and feasible only for big cities. Our role here is to tackle this by providing an easy to implement framework where anyone is able to add value., , This pilot will be deployed at the city campus of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) in Barcelona. It will start by providing a unified system for issue reporting to optimize campus maintenance.

The TRACE (Tracking Agricultural Conditions and Environment) platform aims to improve the end-to-end supply chain management in agri business. From the agricultural producer to the end-consumer, accross whole-sale merchants, food processors and other intermediaries, TRACE will provide services to access product qulity and make-more efficient business decisions. Top do se, TRACE will use state-of-the-art ICT solutions to provide agricultural produce buyers at any stage of the supply chain with so far unsurpassed insight into the quality of the produce and the conditions that it has been subject during its growth., , TRACE is a web platform which connects agricultural producers and their customers and initiates business-to-business (B2B) interaction between them, guided by the actual real-time and historic production data. Using the TRACE platform, agricultural producers can make the conditions in which their products grew public and share them with their customers, be it wholesale merchants, retailers, or end-consumers. In addition to product tracebility and growth-conditions monitoring, TRACE will support the bidding and auction process, sales and ranking of products and producers in terms of reliability and quality. In addition to these services, we envision providing certificates of excellence for the top producers, as well as rating the buyers in terms of reliability.Â  "},{"id_internal":"82b28361-77dc-42e9-9738-2016fbcad88d","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"SOUL-FI","Q1_2":"Netherlands","Q1_3":"ZANERIS","Q1_4":"CYCLODEO","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"A","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"2.00","Q1_8":"1.00","Q1_9":"4999.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Access Control Generic Enabler,GIS Data Provider,Authorization PDP","Q1_13":"10000.00","Q1_16":"3.00","Q2_1":"TRL8","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"30.00","Q3_2b":"10.00","Q3_2c":"60.00","Q3_4":"E,B","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2015","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"B","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"15.00","Q4_3b":"15.00","Q4_3c":"30.00","Q4_3d":"30.00","Q4_4":"C","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"0.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer leisure/gaming","B2B_B2C":"B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Spatial Information Management Software","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Application Development & Deployment","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Data Access, Analysis, and Delivery Software","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"Today, a growing number of European citizens are choosing to cycle to school, work and for shopping. This trend is great news for most of us aspiring to live in smarter and greener cities. Unfortunately, many neighborhoods are not safe and convenient for cycling. Tragedies are often reported in the news such as last November when six cyclists were killed in 13 days in London. , , One of the problems with most biking directions applications is that you are never entirely sure how safe the biking route is before setting off. For instance, many of these applications usually suggests roads you would never consider cycling on and ignores far safer and quieter roads. We propose a solution to address this issue by allowing anyone to preview they cycling rides from the safety of their homes. , , Cyclodeo is a dynamic website that synchronizes Maps, GPS tracks and cycling videos in one page . When a \u2018Cyclodeo ride\u2019 is being replayed, a moving mark is highlighted on the map to indicate the current location of the viewed video. Since each section of the video is geo-coded, you can click anywhere on the cycling track to visualize a specific location from a cyclist\u2019s perspective.  When a city is covered, it allows anyone to see exactly what street conditions they might encounter on a particular cycling ride. We intend to introduce the service in more European cities for the benefit of their citizens., , In the end, the Cyclodeo platform can assist in: , , 1) Monitoring the bicycle traffic and identifying dangerous sections of the road network., 2) Classifying cycling paths based on their type and comfort. , 3) Highlighting infrastructure quality for Transport Planners and showcasing infrastructure improvements. , 4) Complementing existing awareness tools used and enhancing its profile to a larger audience through social media. , 5)Showcasing picturesque cycle routes, supporting tourism marketing initiatives as well as encouraging cycling in and around tourism venues/areas.

We strongly believe that, for the past 2 years, the Viral platform has already contributed to make Portuguese cities smarter by helping citizens to easily acknowledge what is happening in their cities concerning culture and entertainment, and by helping promoters communicate their upcoming events more effectively., , Besides detailed information about events and event promoting organizations, which are searchable through filters (district, type of event, date\u2026) and by an internal search engine, the Viral platform also hosts a collaborative publishing area, a featured events area, metadata and multimedia integration, interactive maps, a tag-based navigation system and a widget that allows event promoters to embed any event list in any website or blog as easily they would with a YouTube video. A mobile app version is already in a planning stage., , Viral was built taking scalability into deep account, and is thus infinitely replicable: having been implemented in Lisbon and Porto in a first stage, the outbreak spread to all the cities of Portugaland is now ready to help smarten up Europe's main destinations. The integration of Fiware technologies will allow us to take this virtual organism to the next level, by integrating capital upgrades such as big data processing, recommendations, context awareness, and possibly cultural analysis and visualization., , By providing detailed, organized and real time information about cultural activities in European cities, Viral can represent a great asset to both citizens and visitors. The targeting capabilities implied in the analysis of users\u2019 profiles and context will also empower event promoters with innovative tools to communicate with target audiences. Finally, the development of data analysis and visualization instruments could provide the cities\u2019 cultural, tourism and governance institutions with invaluable insights about the complex network of interactions amongst cultural agents and between these and their audiences.

SoLoMoN takes advantage of the emerging wave of wearable devices that together with the increasing capabilities of smartphones can take shopping applications\u2019 user experience to the next level., , SoLoMoN connects to: (i) a variety of wearable devices, including but not limited to smart glasses, iWatch, activity-tracking bracelets (ii) a large number of indoor and outdoor localization technologies (including but not limited to: WiFi, BLE/iBeacons, GPS etc.) (iii) social networking platforms and social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, Vine). Data from all such channels is gathered and processed and context cues are used to enhance the user experience and target advertising and offers., , SoLoMoN is made available in the form of a cloud-based platform and a Software Development Toolkit (SDK) that allow developers to quickly prototype and deploy their app. The SDK allows to define complex event triggers (E.g., Google Glass within 10m from position (x,y,z) is in front of an ad of brand QW, and two of my friends like the QW page on Facebook), and to define corresponding actions (E.g., Send a notification on the user\u2019s iWatch that she has a time-limited discount of 20% and that in case she uses it within the next 4 hours her Facebook friends will get a similar voucher). SoLoMoN allows application designers and marketing agencies to focus on the creative aspects of the design of engaging, interactive advertising, and hinders the complexity related to processing in real-time and in a scalable way streams of data coming from different channels and devices., , Target customers of SoLoMoN are marketing companies and brands\u2019 in-house advertising agencies, which can leverage the SoLoMoN platform and SDK to substantially reduce the time (and money) required to design, develop and deploy interactive shopping applications., , The business model underpinning SoLoMoN includes two main streams of revenues. The first revenue stream is a one-time setup fee, which is required to access the SDK for commercial purposes and provides also the ability to setup indoor environments in case they are part of the advertising campaign (including, e.g., providing maps of the environment and/or registration of beaconing devices etc.). The other revenue stream is a recurrent one, based on a monthly fee, for accessing, through the SDK, the services provided by the SoLoMoN platform where all data processing will take place. Three tiers are foreseen for the service fee, depending on the number of users foreseen for the app., , SoLoMoN will include a number of generic FI-WARE enablers, mostly focused on the processing of contextual data and the triggering of application-level actions. Further, various specific FI-CONTENT2 enablers will be integrated to provide means for supporting interaction patterns. FI-WARE enablers will be at the core of the SoLoMoN SDK. Their use will enable the applicant to speed up significantly the design, development and integration processes while achieving significant cost savings. The SoLoMoN platform will be hosted on FI-LAB and will have open APIs. The applicant is committed to contribute to the FI-WARE Community by releasing as open source any enhancement of the FI-WARE GEs/FI-CONTENT2 SEs that will be developed within the scope of the project.Â Â  "},{"id_internal":"67a1ef83-83dd-40e9-aee9-226f33d97c44","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"SOUL-FI","Q1_3":"Connect Robotics ","Q1_4":"Drone Delivery Management Platform ","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"3.00","Q1_8":"4.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"B","Q1_12":"Access Control Generic Enabler,Publish/Subscribe Context Broker,Policy Manager,PEP Proxy ,IoT Broker,Interface Designer,Identity Management,Complex Event Processing,BigData Analysis,Authorization PDP","Q1_13":"75000.00","Q1_16":"1.00","Q2_1":"TRL5","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"A","Q2_4":"A","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"35.00","Q3_2b":"15.00","Q3_2d":"10.00","Q3_2f":"40.00","Q3_3a":"P","Q3_4":"F,D","Q3_5":"B,C","Q3_6":"2017","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"A","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"A","Q3_11":"A","Q3_12":"B","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"1.00","Q4_3b":"10.00","Q4_3c":"1000.00","Q4_3d":"350.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"A","Q4_6":"15.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech Provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"X","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"X","SW_HW":"Hardware","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Services Operations Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Operations and Manufacturing Applications","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"To reduce the amount of capital needed to grow the business., And, to reduce the responsibility to focus on our core strengths. Because they are customers of our customer. And we could set up specific operations for them. Because of the nature of our product. Due to the features of our product. We can sell for hobbyist to DIY at home and we can connect with home automation systems. The Drone Delivery Management Platform project objective is to create a prototype for a safe, secure and reliable drone delivery system., , Drones can reduce 60% of the cost per kg of a parcel delivery, and almost 1/10 of the cost per delivery, comparing with a currier on a electrical scooter. This can reduce the cost for consumers and improve the service level when delivering parcels to hard to reach regions, or by using it as a competitive or strategic advantage. The main customers for this product are logistic operators, who want to offer a wide range of transport modals, and postal service companies, who effort to reduce the delivery cost to its compulsory service., , For this to be possible, the drone should be able to fly beyond line of sight, so it has to fly autonomously, capable of avoid obstacles and it should be aware of other vehicles in the same air space, thus it must be connected with an Air Traffic Controller to authorise flight and manage the airspace according to the regulation permits., , For a logistic operation, there are many fundamental steps required to ensure and organize the process. It include a control panel for delivery setup, notification from receiver accepting the landing, notification for operation that the cargo is ready, and notification of drone readiness. All of this system should be in a cloud server and adopt secure and reliable standards of communication. Here is where FIWARE plays an essential role to integrate the whole solution., , The company is seeking investment and partnerships to perform pilots and complete a commercial prototype., Currently, we are participating on the MIT Portugal Building Global Innovators acceleration program to develop the Go to Market Plan. In this program we are receiving mentorship from CTT innovation department leader. Also, we are incubated at UPTEC, and having mentoring support from an experienced professional.

The system has been already tested and validated at laboratory and small scale field level in the context of SMARTV2G and MOBINCITY FP7 projects, jointly managing navigation and charging as interdependent tasks. The navigation subsystem allows to plan the optimal trip taking into account vehicle autonomy and integrating intermediate fast charging service. The charging control subsystem allows to dinamically control the charging power guaranteeing the satisfaction of drivers preferences in terms of desired state of charge and dwelling time, grid players constraints in terms of aggregated power tracking and release of active demand products, also taking into account the availability of renewable energy sources and the technical limitations on charging current established by the IEC 61851 international standard. The controller exposes a set of services needed to extend traditional electromobility platforms from authentication, monitoring and billing functionalities to control ones; optimization algorithms at the basis of navigation and control services require significant parallel computational capabilities when managing large road maps and a large number of charging sessions, which can be provided by virtual machines through cloud computing. As a matter of fact the IaaS Data Center Resource Management Generic Enabler is expected to provide a significant boost towards the implementation of a solution sufficiently mature to be put on the market; this enabler allows to dinamically and optimally allocate and manage virtual machines on a cloud tailored for the provisioning of the computational effort required to support multiple trip planning services and operation of multiple charging areas along the distribution grid. In the best knowledge of the proposer, though a number of vehicles routing and charging strategies have been presented in the scientific literature, an integrated navigation and charging control system taking into account all the above mentioned aspects has not been put on the market yet.

Citizens are considered service consumers and do not contribute to the reformation process., , On the other side, more and more citizens use smart-phones (smart-phone users globally have surpassed the 1.75 billion in 2014), which usually have a data connection and a number of sensors that provide useful data. This creates an opportunity to apply data mining techniques on movement data and recognize people's daily activities without changing their routine. This information can be further exploited in various applications ranging from healthcare (e.g. fitness application) and transportation (e.g. user's driving habits detection) to entertainment (e.g. POIs suggestions)., , 'Carpe Diem' is a project that builds on existing knowledge and infrastructure in mobile sensor data analytics and recommender systems. Our goal is to develop a platform, where citizens will be able to anonymously share their real life activity information in a transparent way, similar to the way they browse a web site, and receive recommendations that will assist them to improve their quality of life. Recommendations will be based on a crowd-sourcing and collaborative filtering model, but also on information provided in city level.

Above all, a new generation of filmmakers is using the possibilities of modern technology to their own benefit: many vloggers and young production companies, as well as cultural initiatives, local NGOs and companies produce large quantities of high-quality video material about events in their cities or relating to news from specific content areas on a daily basis. Material that could be very interesting for professional users such as media online portals, TV stations or publishers. However, the exchange between new and established video producers remains difficult, as the possibilities for targeted searching for regional or specialised content on conventional video platforms is severely limited. Moreover, the very open nature of the content often results in large uncertainties in relation to copyright and licensing rights. A professional, systematic exchange between suppliers and consumers, therefore, is not possible. We want to enable this exchange with our project. It will act as a digital exchange for local and specialist video productions, on which producers can actively market their content.

Shoes have traditionally been considered a fashion complement when, in fact, they should have been considered a health complement. Many people have come to us to find relief for their afflictions, which were often the consequence of using inappropriate shoes., , Many people who do not use healthy shoes do so because of aesthetic concerns. They prefer to endure pain in their feet, their back or their joints rather than using shoes that do not agree with their aesthetic preferences., , When making shoes, the traditional way of considering a shoe as a whole unit leads to waste of materials. The Open Shoes concept implies making the shoes modular, dividing each shoe in three parts: The midsole (the most important part), the insole (which gives a better feeling to the soles of the feet) and the outer shell. One set with a full range of midsoles and insoles is enough to create all of our shoes. In that way we reduce significantly the use of material and resources., , The most important thing is for the midsole to be as customizable as possible, so that it can spread the pressure along the soles of the feet, absorb impacts, and adjust to each user according to their physical characteristics (mostly their height, the width of their feet and their weight). To do that a public repository will be created by means of repository-sap-ri. At the same time, designs will be made available to the general community in object-storage-ge-fi-ware-implementation, and users will be able to improve it by means of interface-designer. In this way, every user, by means of 3D printing, will be able to create their own midsoles and complement them with the necessary outer shells and insoles., , The goal is to improve musculoskeletal health, which lies at the root of many personal problems and high costs to businesses and the administration.

Many of the approximately 200 million people around the world living with a need for prosthetic/orthotic device don\u2019t have access to this process at all. What is more, a one-size-fits-all approach is used often in the industry, which inevitably compromises comfort and ability., At the heart of 3D printing evolution lies software. It spans the entire 3-D printing lifecycle\u2014from sourcing ideas and designing in three dimensions to delivering formatted data to 3-D printers, and then monitoring and managing the printing process. Software defines and enables interfaces between computers and printers, drives automation, captures intelligence, and integrates processes that make the whole ecosystem hum and move forward., The key challenge of the project is to make mechanical orthosis and prosthesis more accessible and cheaper to the patients with inborn or acquired disability. , We are planning to achieve this by introducing new web based software in the market. The project will define and develop a tool to make process of creating models for prosthetics/orthotics automatic, by combining 3D scanned data, manually entered data and a 3D template. The final product \u2013digital model of mechanical prosthesis/orthosis- will be designed in a way that allows to install smart devices and sensors into the medical device itself and can be printed on almost any 3D printer all around the world. , This idea has been selected to be top 10 idea out of 314 at a local business idea challenge cup called Ideju Kauss 2014. http://www.idejukauss.lv/, In this project it is planned to use these FI-Ware enablers: Application Mashup \u2013 Wirecloud; 3D-UI-XML3D; Identity Management \u2013 KeyRock.

Local governments are investing in improving the cycling infrastructure in their areas. Not applicable Not applicable Today, a growing number of European citizens are choosing to cycle to school, work and for shopping. This trend is great news for most of us aspiring to live in smarter and greener cities. Unfortunately, many neighborhoods are not safe and convenient for cycling. Tragedies are often reported in the news such as last November when six cyclists were killed in 13 days in London. , , One of the problems with most biking directions applications is that you are never entirely sure how safe the biking route is before setting off. For instance, many of these applications usually suggests roads you would never consider cycling on and ignores far safer and quieter roads. We propose a solution to address this issue by allowing anyone to preview they cycling rides from the safety of their homes. , , Cyclodeo is a dynamic website that synchronizes Maps, GPS tracks and cycling videos in one page . When a \u2018Cyclodeo ride\u2019 is being replayed, a moving mark is highlighted on the map to indicate the current location of the viewed video. Since each section of the video is geo-coded, you can click anywhere on the cycling track to visualize a specific location from a cyclist\u2019s perspective.  When a city is covered, it allows anyone to see exactly what street conditions they might encounter on a particular cycling ride. We intend to introduce the service in more European cities for the benefit of their citizens., , In the end, the Cyclodeo platform can assist in: , , 1) Monitoring the bicycle traffic and identifying dangerous sections of the road network., 2) Classifying cycling paths based on their type and comfort. , 3) Highlighting infrastructure quality for Transport Planners and showcasing infrastructure improvements. , 4) Complementing existing awareness tools used and enhancing its profile to a larger audience through social media. , 5)Showcasing picturesque cycle routes, supporting tourism marketing initiatives as well as encouraging cycling in and around tourism venues/areas.

ECOLUP is planned to be a multiplatform based application being accessible from mobile, tablet devices and computers. Our users have either smartphones or tablets with them during their field work, but, according to our previous research, they will prefer to complete their profile in a standard computer. It will retreive some data from FIWARE, and it will be very active in feeding data to FIWARE, which is particularly useful for the organic farming sector due to the scarcity of representative data for this particular sector whose trends and behaviour are normally different from the conventional agri-food sector. We are fostering the creation of new opportunities for the valorisation of agricultural waste, by-and co-products resulting in a better use of resources that nowadays are underexploited, resulting in environmental and economic benefits for the organic community, diminishing also the investment in waste management.

This transmedia strategy aims to reach a native digital audience through different moments and situations (in school and/or home, online and offline)., , , This approach has a strong storytelling purpose. Current affairs are explored by a digital character in a way that transcends the borders of each platform. This main character undertakes a storytelling trip through a physical object, a print product and a digital screen., , , The project is developed around monthly in-depth news coverage that generates a variety of digital participatory activities. The prototype will focus exclusively on the reporting and technological development of this main topic., Â , , NEWSKID\u2019s customers are newspapers, while the target audience consists of children from 8 to 12 years old., , , NEWSKID\u2019s customer segment is regional newspapers around the world. While big media assets can include this type of service within their overall strategy, a project of this scope and technical innovation is all too often out of reach for regional newspapers. NEWSKID provides regional papers with the opportunity to reach young audience with an innovative approach at a very low or negligible risk., , , Children aged from 8 to 12 years old make up our audience. Children of this age are interested about the world and are very participative. This digital generation is used to playing and learning with digital screens as well as with physical objects. NEWSKID utilizes both techniques in a game-like storytelling based on current events., , , NEWSKID\u2019s competitive advantage is based on the conjunction of three main characteristics:, , , - Licensing business model. The licensing model gives exclusivity to each media in their region at a very competitive price. Since the service is open to regional sponsorship, media companies could benefit from the project for free or even to be profitable if the sponsorship amount is higher than the license agreement cost., , , - News core business focus. NEWSKID has a direct impact on the core business of the newspaper, by engaging children with the main role of a news media: reporting on current affairs. Children will associate news reporting with a brand that they might remain loyal to in the future, regardless of platform., , , - Use of transmedia strategy and the Internet of Things. The transmedia approach and the use of Augmented Reality to report on current affairs is a highly innovative solution for the media industry. At this moment there is only one service aimed at children using this technology but it\u2019s not related to news and it\u2019s used in a outlying form., , Â  "},{"id_internal":"14af5ee6-7772-4f81-ba55-b3cf180b5659","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"CREAtiFi","Q1_2":"Denmark","Q1_3":"ido/udo","Q1_4":"Snapalytics","Q1_6a":"B","Q1_6b":"A","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"3.00","Q1_8":"3.00","Q1_9":"0.00","Q1_10":"A","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"BigData Analysis","Q1_13":"50000.00","Q1_16":"0.00","Q2_1":"TRL8","Q2_2":"B","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"0.00","Q3_2b":"100.00","Q3_2c":"0.00","Q3_4":"F,D,B","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2015","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"C","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"C","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"C","Q4_3a":"300.00","Q4_3b":"300.00","Q4_3c":"300.00","Q4_3d":"300.00","Q4_4":"C","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"0.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Horizontal (solutions suitable for every verticals)","B2B_B2C":"B2B","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Tech provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Content Analytics, Discovery, and Cognitive Software","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Content Applications","SME_STARTUP":"","full_text":"Snapchat is becoming more and more popular, and by many used as a blogging and advertising platform.

The Generic Enablers will function as hooks and channels to access these large amounts of information streams (peta byte) of information to develop useful end user applications. We shall utilize these advantages to make FOOODER go beyond present applications for product exploration and product information. It is ambition to make FOOODER a hub of large data streams from various businesses from the chain; and any other information streams available about the food products we expose. Our goal is to leverage FIWARE (and FIspace) technologies and via the use of generic enablers provide an application that brings additional value with a tremendous growth potential.Â  "},{"id_internal":"75dba463-99cf-4a14-ae4c-1402e1922c4c","node_type":"HPI","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"FrontierCities","Q1_2":"Portugal","Q1_3":"MEÌDIA  CORP,  LDA   ","Q1_4":"MAPI","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"A","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"13.00","Q1_8":"15.00","Q1_9":"135000.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_12":"Protocol Adapter,POI Data Provider ,IoT Broker,Identity Management","Q1_13":"135000.00","Q1_16":"3.00","Q2_1":"TRL6","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"A","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2b":"25.00","Q3_2d":"75.00","Q3_3a":"I","Q3_4":"B","Q3_5":"B,C","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"B","Q3_8":"C","Q3_9":"B","Q3_10":"C","Q3_11":"B","Q3_12":"B","Q4_1":"B","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"100.00","Q4_3b":"75.00","Q4_3c":"50.00","Q4_3d":"25.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"100.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"Consumer transport & logistics, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE","B2B_B2C":"B2B/B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"X","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"X","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"","SME_STARTUP":"Startup","full_text":"Public transports are often managed by local authority (municipalities) There are relevant players (private companies) also offering public transport options.

Farmers will gain tools to manage their livestock by location and monitoring of individual animals. Consumers can learn statistics such as: life time and place of life, and reports such as veterinary reports on the meat product they are purchasing. Our SME has developed low cost devices to locate and monitor livestock outdoors. The rancher, through an app, will be able to trace and track individual animals to observe their habits and improve its care. This is a new and powerful smart tool for livestock management, eliminating the locating time for an animal, and sending notifications if any anomalies are detected, for example as a result of a health problem. To accomplish it, physical parameters, such as temperature, will be monitored. The solution will reduce operating costs and will improve the farm results. Furthermore, it can also be adapted to add value to the final product. For instance, the rancher can show how much time has the animal spent outdoors, historical of disease periods per animal, distance and movement estimation. Benefits: \u2022 Identify and locate each animal within the ranch outdoors. \u2022 Detect anomalies like body temperature, absence of activity, abnormal behaviour, or movement out of the confinement enabled areas, etc. \u2022 Long life batteries (between 6-12 months) providing low battery level warming. \u2022 Allow to the farmer to manage in real time his livestock, through a mobile application. Short term objectives: \u2022 Validate the system pilot: devices, interface, features, range, etc. in a real scenario. \u2022 Improve the performance and features of the system through the farmer feedback. \u2022 To develop a marketing strategy to reach the final users in Spain and Europe "},{"id_internal":"79795728-7898-43e6-af32-8fcabe363000","node_type":"normal","Q0_1":"I","Q1_1":"SmartAgri Food2","Q1_2":"Italy","Q1_3":"Meltin'Dot","Q1_4":"TAJ","Q1_6a":"A","Q1_6b":"B","Q1_6c":"B","Q1_7":"4.00","Q1_8":"5.00","Q1_9":"400.00","Q1_10":"B","Q1_11":"A","Q1_12":"Repository,POI Data Provider ,PEP Proxy ,Identity Management,Authorization PDP","Q1_13":"40.00","Q1_16":"6.00","Q2_1":"TRL9","Q2_2":"A","Q2_3":"B","Q2_4":"B","Q2_5":"A","Q3_2a":"0.00","Q3_2b":"100.00","Q3_2c":"0.00","Q3_4":"E,C,B","Q3_5":"D","Q3_6":"2016","Q3_7":"A","Q3_8":"B","Q3_9":"A","Q3_10":"B","Q3_11":"B","Q4_1":"A","Q4_2":"A","Q4_3a":"100.00","Q4_3b":"300.00","Q4_3c":"150.00","Q4_3d":"50.00","Q4_4":"B","Q4_5":"B","Q4_6":"60.00","VERTICAL_MARKET":"AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING, Consumer other","B2B_B2C":"B2B/B2C","PROVIDER_TYPE":"Service provider","ICT_TOOLS_SMART_CITY":"","ICT_TOOLS_CLOUD":"","ICT_TOOLS_SOCIAL_MEDIA":"X","ICT_TOOLS_MOBILE":"","ICT_TOOLS_BIG_DATA":"","ICT_TOOLS_IOT":"","ICT_TOOLS_3D_PRINTING":"","ICT_TOOLS_WEARABLES":"","ICT_TOOLS_ROBOTICS":"","ICT_TOOLS_DRONES":"","SW_HW":"Software","SW_INDIVIDUAL_MARKET":"Human Capital Management","SW_PRIMARY_MARKET":"Applications","SW_SECONDARY_MARKET":"Enterprise Resource Management (ERM) Applications","SME_STARTUP":"SME","full_text":"The Temporary Agricultural Jobs portal is designed as a virtual place where European employers from the agricultural sector meet seasonal job seekers and applicants for apprenticeship.

This comparison will allow cities to know in advance if specific buildings or whole areas are in danger in case of a major earthquake or tornado. If the drift is much bigger than the projected one it is an indication of possible misbehaviour of the structure to the seismic forces., , (b) enabling engineers both in the design and permitting domains to quickly evaluate whether a building structural design complies with a set of regulatory, empirical and statistical rules and best practices. This way the user can easily validate the design against common errors, hidden pain points and other issues that might need special attention. The wide adoption of the eurocodes makes this easy to kickstart for the EMEA area and later aim for global coverage. , , The results of both legs of the system will be visualized on false-color maps of the city where high risk areas/buildings will be highlighted.

These are, in particular, ERP Consultants. When they deal with software operations, they have to explain how to use this or that software. And this requires a good deal of documentation efforts. And it is not only about creating user manuals when a custom or home-grown software (e.g. ERP system) is already implemented. Consultants also take care of business processes re-engineering, system customization, quality assurance process and post-production support. All in all up to 15% of consultants' time is spent on documentation creation. StepShot saves 80% of this time, considerably decreasing the efforts needed to capture system's workflows. Therefore we decided to prioritize this market, bringing both value to our customers and profit to ourselves. The reason for targeting IT specialists has been already explained above. StepShot is a platform for effortless creation of screenshot-based documentation.

This made us decide to put our tech knowledge at the service of those needs., , Â , , We have found that there is a lack of specialised, easy-to-use, online tools for people who work in contemporary art (or have jobs related related to it). This realisation came to us by our experience in our art practice and then reinforced by working and interviewing various artists and cultural managers., , Â , , Tan-TÃ¡n looks to fill that void by creating a platform where people in the art industry \u2013one of the most redituable creative economies on the global market\u2013 can work individually or in collaboration, communicate more efficiently, manage and show their work and create new dynamics, networks and projects for Europe and the rest of the world., , Â , , This will be achieved by providing specialised tools for the different types of users in this industry: artists, curators, collectors, gallerists, private or public art-spaces/institutions and the general public; unlike other platforms, we will not only focus in the well-known artists and institutions, we intend to gather emerging artists, non-institutional art spaces and freelance creatives., , Â , , Through the creation and usage of Tan-TÃ¡n we will be building the organic and up-to-date database of the art-field. One that will help curators and institutions to find information about trends, relations between artists, cross-references among their work and key events in the art world in an specific time and space., , It will also give answers to questions like \u201cwho is participating in this creative industry?\u201d, \u201cwhat do they do?\u201d, \u201cwhere do they live?\u201d; answers that can help researchers and EU institutions \u2013such as cultural ministries\u2013 to get a better knowledge of the industry, it\u2019s people and needs, and act accordingly., , Â , , On the tech front, the platform consists on a web-based application and a series of mobile apps that will take into account two key factors in the art-field: mobility and personalisation. Tan-TÃ¡n will provide the user with access to the information within the platform from multiple locations and devices such as mobile phones or tablets through apps that will behave intelligently according to the user\u2019s profile and field of work., , We are aware that art-making has surrounding activities that are not necessarily tech-related. On that front, the Tan-TÃ¡n will also offer a series of community-related and seminars and gathering to provide non-technical tools such as craft tips, networking and a knowledge base about day-to-day tasks (e.g. how to hand out an invoice?)., , Tan-TÃ¡n has the potential to become the de-facto toolbox for the art industry and their needs. This translates into a global, very ambitious and complex project that will process massive amounts of data generated by end-user interaction both in the virtual and tangible world. Â This is where FI-ware comes into place as the provider of the technologies \u2013namely the ones in the Data/Context Management Architecture chapter\u2013 that will help us to achieve the needs of the enterprise.

Computer-based imaging can also be produced by an entirely new kind of visual content, which also opens up opportunities for new business models. 3D scanning means a computer model of the production of the real world. 3D scanning is different from, for example, Google Street View of the technique used, which provides a point-panoramic images. These panoramic images, therefore, do not constitute eligible for further processing of the computer model. It can be said that the 3D scan takes real-world virtual imaging to a whole new level of quality. The continuous development of technology follows that the 3D images and modeling the quality level continues to rise and recovery of demand will continue to grow strongly. Until now, the most important 3D image content production method has been to the contents of computer modeling, ie models of the production model of the night people at a time. 3D scanning technology has now reached a level where it becomes a competitive alternative to the traditional computer modeling. 3-D scanning allows for faster 3D modeling than traditional methods, and in addition to the final result is more realistic compared to the traditional methods., , Â , , It this project, the central idea is to create an online platform for geospatially tagged 3D LIDAR scans, whereÂ , , the user can access and visualise the scans using a standard web browser., , The service is similar to \u2018Google Streetview\u2019, but the main difference is in allowing the users full access to 3D data.Â , , The data access serves all 3D data based applications, such as 3D visualisation, environmentÂ , , planning and real-estate business. Especially this kind of technique gives benefits to movie and entertainment business for looking new locations, ordering hi-resolution backgrounds and/or using ready locations in production as a backplates. For example, scene in movie, what takes place in different country could plan their shooting day in millimetre accurate, or they could use our data as a background while staying in their own country and saving a lot money when shooting this scene in studio. Now days Hollywood uses LIDAR technique almost in all sceneÂ´s.Â , , Â , , When a customer orders a 3D scan, the team will enter the site and measure it using a Riegl scanner. The data is preprocessed andÂ , , uploaded to a cloud. The customer can access data using standard web browser and see the acquired model with great visual detail. In case the, , customer wants to use the data, he buys the model and downloads it.

Similar to the existing car-sharing initiatives, bike-sharing has become an important part of intermodal transportation and a significant mobility provider for short and medium distances within major cities. , , Hereby multiple sharing-scheme providers have chosen different paths to supply cities with bikes and e-bikes, either station bound or flexible circulating through the cities. Unfortunately many of these providers only show their own resources within their own mobile application to the user. Therefore the bike lending ecosystems compete, rather then grow together as a close network of mobility solutions., , Ã¢\u20acÅVeloyo SharingÃ¢\u20acï¿½ works as a system aggregator and integrates the multiple platforms within a single application. This allows the utilisation of various sharing schemes and therefore strongly increases the efficiency of the bike-sharing and multi-user approach. Through the ability to add specific resources, individual businesses are in the position to add additional specific resources, like for example cargo bikes. Aggregating these existing sharing schemes and additional resources within a single application also enables the user to choose which kind of bike type (bicycle, e-bike or cargo bike) will fit best for its individual and situational needs. This allows bicycle shops also to lend bikes easily to commuters or persons living close to their businesses. Finally, new participants within the bike-lending sector can utilize the Ã¢\u20acÅVeloyo SharingÃ¢\u20acï¿½ infrastructure and register available resources within the app to expand their business activities and participate within the sharing-economy. The Ã¢\u20acÅVeloyo SharingÃ¢\u20acï¿½ infrastructure thus lowers entry costs, gives market access and lower therefore important entry barriers for new players.

The outcome in 2013 was a lightweight, handheld and battery operated analytical device for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOC) in gases. The device makes use of a chromatography multi-capillary and a photoionization detector (sensor)., , The device is an innovation awarded several times; for example by winning the 2014 INNOTECH business plan competition. In November 2014 the startup bentekk GmbH was incorporated by the two TUHH and NIT alumni Matthias Schmittmann and Johannes Weber to further develop the prototype to market readiness. The young entrepreneurs are supported by the TUHH StartupDock, the EXIST scholarship and the IFB Hamburg program InnoRampUp. In the SpeedUp Europe project, bentekk joins forces with the web developer Felix Wittmann, the iOS developer Arne JÃÂ¼nemann and the peak detection algorithm expert Paul Weber., , Based on a deep understanding of the market of portable environmental measurement devices, the team plans to create an additional service for bentekk: The cloud-based web platform bencloud will display, enhance and connect measured data in a seemly way. First for bentekkÃ¢\u20acâ¢s device. In a second step, we plan to open the platform for other measurement devices. A more visionary perspective sees the possibility to connect many devices over the web platform in an intelligent manner. The sensor data can be used to create profiles about contamination of sites or even whole cities. Bencloud will be sold to measurement device users in a freemium business model and individual connectors will be developed for device manufacturers.

European meteorological networks, working at different spatial scales, are currently handling their own data with unconnected management system. This makes the access to data difficult, which is an essential prerequisite for any implementation process of information on climate and pests. We propose a set of modular applications adopting FIWARE technologies to develop Decision Support System (DSS) in support of area-wide IPM. The system will be based on free agrometeorological data from public and private providers in Italy, Spain and Greece. Insect phenology will be modelled, and interfaced with monitoring programs and geostatistical algorithms. Four major crops will be targeted: corn, tomato, grapevine and olive. A specific focus on pest development, agrometeorological modelling, and environmental safety will be pursued IPM applications on arable farming (corn), and horticultural crops (tomato, grape and olive). Open access agrometeorological data will be implemented in a model environment for the sustainable management of the most important pests for these crops. The main benefits are the optimization of spatio-temporal IPM applications and the flexible use of farm-specific information modules. The open system platform will provide the data in real time, as required by large companies and/or consortia and cooperatives that offer services for large territorial scale and long-term purposes. The use of FIWARE and FI-space will ensure networking and reciprocal integration of results by groups of end users and ICT developers. The in-kind contribution of Regional Phytosanitary Service of Tuscany and DuPont Evalio AgroSystems, a public local authority and a multinational enterprise, working on pest management and food processor, respectively, will provide test bed to trial the results of mathematical models and DSS.
